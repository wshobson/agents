| Rank | Ticker | Risk-Adjusted Score | Sharpe Ratio Proxy | Rationale |
|------|--------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **1** | **QCOM** | **8.5/10** | **Highest** | Best balance: 12-16% growth, 42% ROE, P/E 14x, 2% yield, lowest volatility (beta ~1.0-1.5), diversified business model |
| **2** | **NVDA** | **8.0/10** | **High** | Highest absolute potential (94% growth) but beta 2.12 and P/E 56x increase volatility; dominant position offsets risk |
| **3** | **AMD** | **6.0/10** | **Medium** | Strong growth (28-33%) but P/E 147x, export control risk, profitability gap, and high beta create unfavorable risk/reward at current levels |
| **4** | **INTC** | **4.0/10** | **Low** | Pure speculation on turnaround with negative profitability, execution risk, and competitive losses; risk far exceeds potential reward |

### Sharpe Ratio Analysis

**Methodology:** Risk-adjusted return = Expected Return / Volatility (Beta proxy)

**QCOM:**
- Expected Return: 15-20% (12% revenue growth + multiple expansion potential + 2% dividend)
- Beta: ~1.0-1.5
- Risk-Adjusted Return: 10-20% / 1.25 = **8-16%**
- **Best risk-adjusted profile**

**NVDA:**
- Expected Return: 25-35% (strong growth continuation)
- Beta: 2.12
- Risk-Adjusted Return: 30% / 2.12 = **14%**
- **High absolute return but also high volatility**

**AMD:**
- Expected Return: 15-25% (growth potential offset by valuation risk)
- Beta: ~2.0
- Risk-Adjusted Return: 20% / 2.0 = **10%**
- **Growth potential offset by valuation and execution risks**

**INTC:**
- Expected Return: -10% to +40% (binary turnaround outcome)
- Beta: ~1.5 (plus execution risk)
- Risk-Adjusted Return: Undefined (negative expected value for most investors)
- **Risk far exceeds reward; avoid except as speculation**

### Portfolio Construction Implications

## 5. FINAL SYNTHESIS & ACTION ITEMS

### Investment Ratings Summary

| Ticker | Rating | Target Allocation | Price Target (12-mo) | Risk Level | Expected Return |
|--------|--------|------------------|---------------------|------------|-----------------|
| **NVDA** | **STRONG BUY** | 30-40% | $230-250 | High | 25-35% |
| **QCOM** | **BUY** | 30-40% | $210-225 | Medium | 15-20% |
| **AMD** | **HOLD** | 10-20% | $240-280 | High | 10-20% (from pullback) |
| **INTC** | **HOLD** | 0-10% | $35-50 | Very High | -10% to +40% (binary) |

### Executive Investment Recommendations

#### Key Takeaways

1. **NVIDIA (NVDA) is the quality growth leader** with unmatched AI positioning, exceptional margins (75% gross, 64% operating), and dominant market share (90% AI accelerators). Despite elevated valuation (P/E 56.79), PEG ratio of 0.94 indicates growth more than justifies premium. Suitable for growth investors who can accept high volatility (beta 2.12).

2. **Qualcomm (QCOM) offers best risk-adjusted value** combining reasonable valuation (P/E 14.08), solid growth (12-16%), strong profitability (ROE 42%), income (2.07% yield), and lowest volatility. Diversified business model and strong technical setup (7 bullish indicators) make it the top choice for balanced and risk-averse investors.

3. **AMD is expensive at current levels** - P/E of 147.43 offers no margin of safety despite credible #2 position in AI GPUs. Better entry point needed at $220-230 range. Export control risk ($800M Q2 charge) and profitability gap versus NVDA (ROE 3.85% vs 70%+) warrant caution.

4. **Intel (INTC) is pure speculation** - Negative profitability (ROE -21%, ROA -11%, Net Margin -39%) makes this a turnaround bet, not an investment. Only suitable for small speculative positions (5-10% max) with high risk tolerance. Most investors should avoid until clear evidence of sustainable profitability improvement.

5. **Sector remains attractive** driven by multi-year AI infrastructure buildout, but selectivity matters. Focus on NVDA and QCOM for core exposure.
