## Usage

### Agent Invocation

After installing plugins, agents are automatically available. Invoke them explicitly in natural language:

```
"Use backend-architect to design the authentication API"
"Have security-auditor scan for OWASP vulnerabilities"
"Get performance-engineer to optimize this database query"
```

Claude Code automatically selects and coordinates the appropriate agents based on your request.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration Examples

Plugins provide pre-configured multi-agent workflows that coordinate complex operations:

**Full-Stack Development Plugin**
```
"Implement user dashboard with real-time analytics"
```
→ backend-architect → graphql-architect → frontend-developer → mobile-developer → test-automator → security-auditor → performance-engineer → deployment-engineer

**Security Hardening Plugin**
```
"Perform security audit and implement OWASP best practices"
```
→ security-auditor → backend-security-coder → frontend-security-coder → mobile-security-coder → test-automator

**Data/ML Pipeline Plugin**
```
"Build customer churn prediction model with deployment"
```

**Incident Response Plugin**
```
"Debug production memory leak and create runbook"
```
→ incident-responder → devops-troubleshooter → debugger → error-detective → observability-engineer

3. Write clear activation criteria in the description
4. Define comprehensive system prompt with expertise areas

### Subagent Format

Each subagent is defined as a Markdown file with frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: subagent-name
description: Activation criteria for this subagent
model: haiku|sonnet|opus  # Optional: Model selection
tools: tool1, tool2       # Optional: Tool restrictions
---

System prompt defining the subagent's expertise and behavior
```

### Model Selection Criteria

- **haiku**: Simple, deterministic tasks with minimal reasoning
