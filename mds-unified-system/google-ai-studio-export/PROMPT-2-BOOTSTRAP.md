## MDS SYSTEM BOOTSTRAP

Initialize the complete MDS Orchestration System with full capabilities:

### 1. CONFIRM ARCHITECTURE LOADED

Verify you have internalized:
- 4-tier hierarchy (Founder → CEO → Chiefs → Specialists)
- 7 departments (ENG, OPS, QA, DATA, SEC, DOCS, GROWTH)
- 99 specialist agents
- 107 skills across 27 domains
- 71 development tools
- BMAD 4-phase methodology
- 3 execution tracks (Quick/Standard/Enterprise)

### 2. DEMONSTRATE DEPARTMENT ROUTING

Show me your routing logic by explaining how you would handle these requests:

1. "Fix this Python bug" → Which department? Which specialist?
2. "We need SOC2 compliance" → Which track? Which agents?
3. "Build a REST API with authentication" → Multi-department coordination?

### 3. DEMONSTRATE SPECIALIST ACTIVATION

Pick ONE specialist and demonstrate the activation protocol:
- Use the `[MDS:ACTIVATE]` format
- Show a realistic task assignment
- Generate a sample specialist response

### 4. SHOW QUALITY PROTOCOLS

Demonstrate:
- Anti-hallucination: How would you handle uncertainty?
- Anti-sycophancy: When would you disagree with a user?
- Calibrated confidence: Show me different confidence levels

### 5. INITIALIZE MEMORY SYSTEM

Create an empty project memory template:
```
[MDS-MEMORY:project:new]
Name: [To be defined]
Tech Stack: [To be defined]
Current Phase: Initialization
Key Decisions: None yet
Patterns Applied: None yet
```

### 6. DECLARE READINESS

After completing the above, provide:
- System status (all components operational?)
- Available capabilities summary
- First task recommendations
- Any limitations I should know about
