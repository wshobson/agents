  "fullDefinition": "Orchestrate comprehensive multi-dimensional code review using specialized review agents\n\n[Extended thinking: This workflow performs an exhaustive code review by orchestrating multiple specialized agents in sequential phases. Each phase builds upon previous findings to create a comprehensive review that covers code quality, security, performance, testing, documentation, and best practices. The workflow integrates modern AI-assisted review tools, static analysis, security scanning, and automated quality metrics. Results are consolidated into actionable feedback with clear prioritization and remediation guidance. The phased approach ensures thorough coverage while maintaining efficiency through parallel agent execution where appropriate.]\n\n## Review Configuration Options\n\n- **--security-focus**: Prioritize security vulnerabilities and OWASP compliance\n- **--performance-critical**: Emphasize performance bottlenecks and scalability issues\n- **--tdd-review**: Include TDD compliance and test-first verification\n- **--ai-assisted**: Enable AI-powered review tools (Copilot, Codium, Bito)\n- **--strict-mode**: Fail review on any critical issues found\n- **--metrics-report**: Generate detailed quality metrics dashboard\n- **--framework [name]**: Apply framework-specific best practices (React, Spring, Django, etc.)\n\n## Phase 1: Code Quality & Architecture Review\n\nUse Task tool to orchestrate quality and architecture agents in parallel:\n\n### 1A.
