The coordination strategy emphasizes shared contracts and parallel development with regular synchronization points. By establishing API contracts and data models upfront, teams can work independently while ensuring consistency. The workflow benefits include faster time-to-market, reduced integration issues, and maintainable cross-platform codebases.]\n\n## Phase 1: Architecture and API Design (Sequential)\n\n### 1.
