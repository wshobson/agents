Each phase builds on previous outputs, ensuring coherent feature delivery. The workflow supports multiple development methodologies (traditional, TDD/BDD, DDD), feature complexity levels, and modern deployment strategies including feature flags, gradual rollouts, and observability-first development. Agents receive detailed context from previous phases to maintain consistency and quality throughout the development lifecycle.]\n\n## Configuration Options\n\n### Development Methodology\n- **traditional**: Sequential development with testing after implementation\n- **tdd**: Test-Driven Development with red-green-refactor cycles\n- **bdd**: Behavior-Driven Development with scenario-based testing\n- **ddd**: Domain-Driven Design with bounded contexts and aggregates\n\n### Feature Complexity\n- **simple**: Single service, minimal integration (1-2 days)\n- **medium**: Multiple services, moderate integration (3-5 days)\n- **complex**: Cross-domain, extensive integration (1-2 weeks)\n- **epic**: Major architectural changes, multiple teams (2+ weeks)\n\n### Deployment Strategy\n- **direct**: Immediate rollout to all users\n- **canary**: Gradual rollout starting with 5% of traffic\n- **feature-flag**: Controlled activation via feature toggles\n- **blue-green**: Zero-downtime deployment with instant rollback\n- **a-b-test**: Split traffic for experimentation and metrics\n\n## Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements Planning\n\n1. **Business Analysis & Requirements**\n   - Use Task tool with subagent_type=\"business-analytics::business-analyst\"\n   - Prompt: \"Analyze feature requirements for: $ARGUMENTS.
