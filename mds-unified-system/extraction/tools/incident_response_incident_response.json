  "fullDefinition": "Orchestrate multi-agent incident response with modern SRE practices for rapid resolution and learning:\n\n[Extended thinking: This workflow implements a comprehensive incident command system (ICS) following modern SRE principles. Multiple specialized agents collaborate through defined phases: detection/triage, investigation/mitigation, communication/coordination, and resolution/postmortem. The workflow emphasizes speed without sacrificing accuracy, maintains clear communication channels, and ensures every incident becomes a learning opportunity through blameless postmortems and systematic improvements.]\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Severity Levels\n- **P0/SEV-1**: Complete outage, security breach, data loss - immediate all-hands response\n- **P1/SEV-2**: Major degradation, significant user impact - rapid response required\n- **P2/SEV-3**: Minor degradation, limited impact - standard response\n- **P3/SEV-4**: Cosmetic issues, no user impact - scheduled resolution\n\n### Incident Types\n- Performance degradation\n- Service outage\n- Security incident\n- Data integrity issue\n- Infrastructure failure\n- Third-party service disruption\n\n## Phase 1: Detection & Triage\n\n### 1.
