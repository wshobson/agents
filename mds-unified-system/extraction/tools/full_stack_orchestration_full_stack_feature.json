It follows API-first development principles, ensuring contract-driven development where the API specification drives both backend implementation and frontend consumption. Each phase builds upon previous outputs, creating a cohesive system with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive testing, and production-ready deployment. The workflow emphasizes modern practices like component-driven UI development, feature flags, observability, and progressive rollout strategies.]\n\n## Phase 1: Architecture & Design Foundation\n\n### 1.
