# Multi-Agent Optimization Toolkit

## Role: AI-Powered Multi-Agent Performance Engineering Specialist

### Context
The Multi-Agent Optimization Tool is an advanced AI-driven framework designed to holistically improve system performance through intelligent, coordinated agent-based optimization. Leveraging cutting-edge AI orchestration techniques, this tool provides a comprehensive approach to performance engineering across multiple domains.

### Core Capabilities
- Intelligent multi-agent coordination
- Performance profiling and bottleneck identification
- Adaptive optimization strategies
- Cross-domain performance optimization
- Cost and efficiency tracking

## Arguments Handling
The tool processes optimization arguments with flexible input parameters:
- `$TARGET`: Primary system/application to optimize
- `$PERFORMANCE_GOALS`: Specific performance metrics and objectives
- `$OPTIMIZATION_SCOPE`: Depth of optimization (quick-win, comprehensive)
- `$BUDGET_CONSTRAINTS`: Cost and resource limitations
- `$QUALITY_METRICS`: Performance quality thresholds

## 1. Multi-Agent Performance Profiling

### Profiling Strategy
- Distributed performance monitoring across system layers
- Real-time metrics collection and analysis
- Continuous performance signature tracking

#### Profiling Agents
1. **Database Performance Agent**
   - Query execution time analysis
   - Index utilization tracking
   - Resource consumption monitoring

2. **Application Performance Agent**
   - CPU and memory profiling
   - Algorithmic complexity assessment
   - Concurrency and async operation analysis

3. **Frontend Performance Agent**
   - Rendering performance metrics
   - Network request optimization
   - Core Web Vitals monitoring

### Profiling Code Example
```python
def multi_agent_profiler(target_system):
    agents = [
        DatabasePerformanceAgent(target_system),
        ApplicationPerformanceAgent(target_system),
        FrontendPerformanceAgent(target_system)
    ]

    performance_profile = {}
    for agent in agents:
        performance_profile[agent.__class__.__name__] = agent.profile()

    return aggregate_performance_metrics(performance_profile)
```

## 2. Context Window Optimization

### Optimization Techniques
- Intelligent context compression
- Semantic relevance filtering
- Dynamic context window resizing
- Token budget management

### Context Compression Algorithm
```python
def compress_context(context, max_tokens=4000):
    # Semantic compression using embedding-based truncation
    compressed_context = semantic_truncate(
        context,
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
        importance_threshold=0.7
    )
    return compressed_context
```

## 3. Agent Coordination Efficiency

### Coordination Principles
- Parallel execution design
- Minimal inter-agent communication overhead
- Dynamic workload distribution
- Fault-tolerant agent interactions

### Orchestration Framework
```python
class MultiAgentOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, agents):
        self.agents = agents
        self.execution_queue = PriorityQueue()
        self.performance_tracker = PerformanceTracker()

    def optimize(self, target_system):
        # Parallel agent execution with coordinated optimization
        with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
            futures = {
                executor.submit(agent.optimize, target_system): agent
                for agent in self.agents
            }

            for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
                agent = futures[future]
                result = future.result()
                self.performance_tracker.log(agent, result)
```

## 4. Parallel Execution Optimization

### Key Strategies
- Asynchronous agent processing
- Workload partitioning
- Dynamic resource allocation
- Minimal blocking operations

## 5. Cost Optimization Strategies

### LLM Cost Management
- Token usage tracking
- Adaptive model selection
- Caching and result reuse
- Efficient prompt engineering

### Cost Tracking Example
```python
class CostOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.token_budget = 100000  # Monthly budget
        self.token_usage = 0
        self.model_costs = {
            'gpt-4': 0.03,
            'claude-3-sonnet': 0.015,
            'claude-3-haiku': 0.0025
        }

    def select_optimal_model(self, complexity):
        # Dynamic model selection based on task complexity and budget
        pass
```

## 6. Latency Reduction Techniques

- Pre-warming agent contexts
- Intelligent result memoization
- Reduced round-trip communication

## 7. Quality vs Speed Tradeoffs

### Optimization Spectrum
