# OKR Planning Command

Facilitate a structured OKR (Objectives and Key Results) planning process for teams or organizations using proven methodologies from Google, Intel, and other high-performing companies.

## Planning Process

### Pre-Work (Before Planning Session)

1. **Review Context**:
   - Previous quarter/year OKR results and learnings
   - Company strategy and priorities
   - Market and competitive landscape
   - Available resources and constraints

2. **Gather Input**:
   - Leadership priorities (top-down)
   - Team proposals (bottom-up)
   - Customer feedback and insights
   - Performance data and trends

3. **Set Expectations**:
   - OKR principles and methodology
   - Planning timeline and process
   - Roles and decision-making
   - Success criteria for good OKRs

### Step 1: Define Planning Scope

Ask:
1. **Timeframe**: Quarterly (Q1-Q4) or Annual?
2. **Level**: Company, Department, Team, or Individual?
3. **Participants**: Who should be involved?
4. **Context**: What's the strategic backdrop?
5. **Constraints**: Any must-haves or limitations?

### Step 2: Review Previous Period

**Analyze Last Quarter/Year**:
- Score all OKRs (0.0 - 1.0 scale)
- What did we achieve? What did we miss?
- What worked well? What didn't?
- What did we learn?
- What should continue? What should stop?

**Key Questions**:
- Average OKR score (0.7 is healthy)
- Were OKRs too easy (>0.9) or too hard (<0.5)?
- Did we work on right things?
- Were we aligned as organization?
- What blockers prevented achievement?

### Step 3: Clarify Strategic Context

**Company Strategy**:
- What's the vision and mission?
- What are strategic priorities?
- What's changing in market/competition?
- What must we accomplish?
- What are growth targets?

**Dependencies**:
- What do we depend on from others?
- What do others depend on from us?
- How do we align across teams?

### Step 4: Brainstorm Objectives

**Characteristics of Great Objectives**:
- Inspirational and motivating
- Qualitative (not metrics)
- Time-bound (this quarter/year)
- Action-oriented (active verbs)
- Memorable and concise
- Team-owned and committed

**Brainstorming Questions**:
- What would make this quarter/year a huge success?
- What breakthroughs or achievements matter most?
- Where should we focus to have biggest impact?
- What would delight our customers?
- What would set us up for long-term success?

**Brainstorm Method**:
1. Individual silent brainstorming (5 min)
2. Share ideas round-robin (15 min)
3. Group and theme (10 min)
4. Prioritize with voting (10 min)
5. Select top 3-5 objectives

**Good Objective Examples**:
- "Delight customers with exceptional performance"
- "Become the most trusted platform for developers"
- "Build a world-class engineering organization"
- "Dominate the enterprise market segment"

**Avoid**:
- Vague objectives ("Improve system")
- Metrics as objectives ("Achieve $50M ARR")
- Business-as-usual ("Ship planned features")
- Too many objectives (>5)

### Step 5: Define Key Results

For each Objective, create 3-5 Key Results.

**Characteristics of Great Key Results**:
- Measurable (numbers, %, currency)
- Verifiable (objectively assessed)
- Ambitious (70% achievement = success)
- Time-bound (end of period)
- Specific (no ambiguity)
- Outcome-focused (not activities)

**Key Result Formulas**:
- Increase [metric] from [X] to [Y]
- Achieve [metric] of [target]
- Launch [product] with [success metric]
- Reduce [metric] from [X] to [Y]

**Drafting Questions**:
- How will we know we achieved the objective?
- What metrics truly indicate success?
- What's our baseline? What's our stretch target?
- Can we objectively measure this?
- Is 70% achievement realistic but challenging?

**Good Key Result Examples**:
- "Increase NPS from 42 to 70"
- "Reduce P95 latency from 500ms to 100ms"
- "Achieve 99.99% uptime"
- "Close $50M in new ARR"
- "Launch mobile app with 50K+ downloads in first month"

**Avoid**:
- Activities ("Conduct 10 customer interviews")
- Vague metrics ("Improve performance")
- Too easy (guaranteed 100% achievement)
- Unmeasurable ("Better culture")
- Missing baseline or target

### Step 6: Ensure Alignment

**Vertical Alignment** (Top-Down):
- Do team OKRs support department OKRs?
- Do department OKRs support company OKRs?
- Is chain of impact clear?

**Horizontal Alignment** (Cross-Team):
- Are there dependencies or handoffs?
- Are teams working toward shared goals?
- Are there conflicts or competition?

**Alignment Test**:
"If we achieve this Key Result, does it meaningfully contribute to the parent Objective?"

### Step 7: Review and Refine

**Quality Check**:

For each OKR, ask:
- [ ] Is objective inspirational and qualitative?
- [ ] Are key results measurable and specific?
- [ ] Is this ambitious (70% = success)?
- [ ] Is this aligned to higher-level goals?
- [ ] Do we have capacity and resources?
- [ ] Are we committed to this?
- [ ] Can we track progress weekly?

**Refinement Questions**:
- Is anything missing?
- Is anything redundant?
- Are we focused (3-5 objectives max)?
- Is language clear and precise?
- Do we all understand and commit?

### Step 8: Assign Ownership

For each OKR:
- **Owner**: Who is accountable for achievement?
- **Contributors**: Who will help?
- **Stakeholders**: Who needs to be informed?
- **Dependencies**: What's needed from others?

**Ownership Principles**:
- Single owner per objective (clear accountability)
- Owner has authority and resources
- Owner commits to weekly updates
- Owner can ask for help

### Step 9: Plan Tracking and Review

**Tracking**:
- Where will OKRs be documented? (Spreadsheet, OKR tool)
- How will progress be updated? (Weekly)
- How will confidence be indicated? (Green/Yellow/Red)
- Who can see OKRs? (Transparent to all)

**Review Cadence**:
- **Weekly**: Team check-ins on progress
- **Monthly**: Deeper review and adjustments
- **Quarterly**: Grading and retrospective
- **Ad-hoc**: When OKR goes Red

**Confidence Levels**:
- 🟢 Green (On Track): 70%+ confidence
- 🟡 Yellow (At Risk): 40-69% confidence
- 🔴 Red (Off Track): <40% confidence

### Step 10: Communicate and Launch

**OKR Communication**:
1. **Document**: Write in standard format
2. **Present**: Share in team/all-hands meeting
3. **Publish**: Make visible company-wide
4. **Explain**: Clarify rationale and alignment
5. **Inspire**: Generate excitement and commitment

**Launch Checklist**:
- [ ] All OKRs documented in tracking system
- [ ] Owners assigned and committed
- [ ] Presented to team and organization
- [ ] Published for transparency
- [ ] Review cadence scheduled
- [ ] Tracking dashboard created

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Too Many OKRs**: Stick to 3-5 objectives
2. **Sandbagging**: Ensure 70% achievement is ambitious
3. **Activity-Based KRs**: Focus on outcomes, not tasks
4. **No Team Input**: Collaborative, not top-down imposed
5. **Set and Forget**: Weekly review is critical
6. **Misalignment**: Connect to higher-level goals
7. **Vague Metrics**: Be specific and measurable
8. **Business-as-Usual**: OKRs are for stretch goals

## Output Deliverables

After OKR planning, provide:
1. **Complete OKR document** in standard format
2. **Alignment map** showing connections to company OKRs
3. **Tracking dashboard** with weekly update mechanism
4. **Communication presentation** for broader sharing
5. **Review calendar** with scheduled check-ins
