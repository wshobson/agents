### Step 4: Define Desired Future Culture

**Vision**:

- What would attract and retain top talent?

**Core Values** (3-7):
- What principles should guide us?
- What behaviors should we reward?
- What's non-negotiable?
- What makes us unique?

**Behavioral Translation**:
For each value, define 3-5 observable behaviors.

Example:
```
Value: Customer Obsession

Behaviors:
1. Start every decision by asking "What's best for customer?"
2. Spend time with customers weekly
3. Use customer feedback in every product decision
4. Measure and track customer satisfaction relentlessly
5. Empower employees to solve customer problems
```

### Step 5: Gap Analysis

**Current vs Desired**:

|-----------|--------------|---------------|-----|----------|
| Values Alignment | 4/10 | 9/10 | -5 | High |
| Psychological Safety | 6/10 | 9/10 | -3 | High |
| Innovation | 5/10 | 8/10 | -3 | Medium |
| Customer Focus | 7/10 | 9/10 | -2 | Medium |
| Accountability | 6/10 | 9/10 | -3 | High |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Prioritization**:
- Which gaps have biggest business impact?
- Which are most achievable?
- Which are prerequisites for others?
- What quick wins are possible?

### Step 6: Transformation Strategy

**Change Approach**:
- What's the overall transformation timeline? (3-5 years)
- What phases? (Assess → Define → Align → Launch → Embed → Sustain)
- What governance structure?
- Who sponsors and leads?
