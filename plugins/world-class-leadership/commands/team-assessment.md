# Team Assessment Command

Conduct a comprehensive assessment of a team's health, performance, and dynamics. This command helps identify strengths, gaps, and opportunities for improvement.

## Assessment Process

### Step 1: Gather Context

Ask the following questions:
1. **Team Information**:
   - Team name and size
   - Team purpose and mission
   - How long has team existed?
   - Recent changes or challenges?

2. **Assessment Scope**:
   - What prompted this assessment?
   - Any specific concerns or focus areas?
   - Who should be involved in assessment?

### Step 2: Assess Five Key Dimensions

Based on Google's Project Aristotle research, evaluate:

#### 1. Psychological Safety (1-10)
- Can team members take risks without feeling insecure?
- Do people feel comfortable being vulnerable?
- Are mistakes treated as learning opportunities?
- Can people voice opinions and concerns?

**Evidence to Review**:
- Meeting participation patterns
- How conflicts are handled
- How failures are discussed
- Questions and challenges raised

#### 2. Dependability (1-10)
- Do team members deliver on commitments?
- Is work completed with high quality?
- Can people count on each other?
- Are deadlines met consistently?

**Evidence to Review**:
- Sprint completion rates
- Quality metrics
- Commitment vs delivery
- Feedback on reliability

#### 3. Structure & Clarity (1-10)
- Are roles and responsibilities clear?
- Are goals well-defined and understood?
- Are processes and workflows documented?
- Is decision-making clear?

**Evidence to Review**:
- RACI or role documentation
- OKRs or goal documentation
- Process documentation
- Decision-making clarity

#### 4. Meaning (1-10)
- Is work personally important to team members?
- Do people find work fulfilling?
- Does work align with personal values?
- Do people feel sense of purpose?

**Evidence to Review**:
- Engagement survey results
- 1-on-1 conversation themes
- Voluntary effort and initiative
- Connection to company mission

#### 5. Impact (1-10)
- Do team members believe work matters?
- Is team impact visible and measurable?
- Do people see how work affects customers/business?
- Is progress recognized?

**Evidence to Review**:
- Metrics and KPIs
- Customer feedback visibility
- Recognition frequency
- Connection to business outcomes

### Step 3: Additional Assessment Dimensions

#### Collaboration (1-10)
- How well does team work together?
- Is communication effective?
- Do people help each other?
- Is knowledge sharing happening?

#### Innovation (1-10)
- Does team generate new ideas?
- Is experimentation encouraged?
- Are different approaches tried?
- Is creativity valued?

#### Execution (1-10)
- Does team deliver results?
- Is work completed efficiently?
- Are blockers removed quickly?
- Is quality maintained?

#### Engagement (1-10)
- Are team members motivated?
- Is energy and enthusiasm present?
- Do people enjoy working together?
- Is turnover low?

#### Development (1-10)
- Are team members growing skills?
- Are learning opportunities provided?
- Is coaching and feedback happening?
- Are career paths supported?

### Step 4: Analyze Results

**Calculate Scores**:
- Average score across all dimensions
- Identify highest and lowest scoring areas
- Compare to benchmarks (7-8 is healthy)

**Identify Patterns**:
- What themes emerge?
- Are there interdependencies?
- What are root causes?
- What are quick wins?

### Step 5: Generate Recommendations

**Prioritize Interventions**:
1. **Critical** (Score <5): Immediate action required
2. **Important** (Score 5-6): Address within quarter
3. **Optimize** (Score 7-8): Continue and enhance
4. **Maintain** (Score 9-10): Keep doing what's working

**Create Action Plan**:

For each priority area:
- **What**: Specific intervention or change
- **Why**: Expected impact
- **How**: Implementation approach
- **Who**: Owner and participants
- **When**: Timeline and milestones
- **Success**: How to measure improvement

### Step 6: Present Findings

**Assessment Report Structure**:
