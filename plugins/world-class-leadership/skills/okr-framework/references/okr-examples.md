## OKR Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

### ❌ Bad Objective Examples

**Too Vague**:
- "Improve the product" - What aspect? By how much? Why?

**Actually a Key Result (metric)**:
- "Achieve $50M in revenue" - This is a KR, not an objective

**Business-as-Usual**:
- "Ship planned roadmap features" - Not ambitious or strategic

**Too Many**:
- 10 objectives for a team - Impossible to focus

### ❌ Bad Key Result Examples

**Not Measurable**:
- "Improve customer satisfaction" - No baseline or target

**Activity, Not Outcome**:
- "Conduct 20 customer interviews" - Focus on outcome of interviews

**Too Easy (Sandbagging)**:
- "Increase signups from 1000 to 1001" - Not ambitious

**Missing Baseline or Target**:
- "Grow revenue" - From what to what?

**Unmeasurable**:
- "Build better culture" - How measured?

## Tips for Writing Great OKRs

### Objectives Should Be:
✅ **Inspirational**: "Delight customers" not "Improve metrics"
✅ **Qualitative**: No numbers in objectives
✅ **Time-Bound**: Quarterly or annual
✅ **Memorable**: Can you recall all your objectives?
✅ **Limited**: 3-5 max

### Key Results Should Be:
✅ **Measurable**: Numbers, percentages, currency
✅ **Verifiable**: Can objectively check if achieved
✅ **Ambitious**: 70% achievement = success
✅ **Specific**: From [X] to [Y], no ambiguity
✅ **Outcome-focused**: Results, not activities
