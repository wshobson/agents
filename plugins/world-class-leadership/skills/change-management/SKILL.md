3. Poor communication (24%)
4. Resistance not addressed (22%)
5. Inadequate resources (18%)
6. No sense of urgency (15%)
7. Premature victory declaration (12%)

## Kotter's 8-Step Change Process

### Step 1: Create Urgency
**Goal**: Make change compelling and necessary

**Actions**:
- Identify potential threats and opportunities
- Examine market and competitive realities
- Discuss crises, potential crises, or opportunities
- Create "burning platform" or aspirational vision

**Example**: "If we don't transform now, we'll lose 40% market share in 2 years"

### Step 2: Build Guiding Coalition
**Goal**: Assemble powerful change leadership team

**Actions**:
- Identify key leaders and influencers
- Build diverse coalition (roles, levels, functions)
- Ensure coalition has power to lead change
- Create trust and shared purpose
- Meet regularly to drive change

**Tip**: Need executives, managers, and informal leaders

### Step 3: Form Strategic Vision
**Goal**: Create clear, compelling vision for change

**Actions**:
- Develop vision for future state
- Create strategies to achieve vision
- Ensure vision is clear, concise, memorable
- Test vision - can you explain in <5 minutes?

**Example**: "Become the most customer-centric company in our industry"

### Step 4: Enlist Volunteer Army
**Goal**: Build broad base of change agents

**Actions**:
- Communicate vision widely and repeatedly
- Lead by example and model desired behaviors
- Address concerns and questions openly
- Inspire voluntary participation
- Create change champion network

**Tip**: Need 10-15% of organization as active champions

### Step 5: Enable Action by Removing Barriers
**Goal**: Remove obstacles to change

**Actions**:
- Identify and remove structural barriers
- Change systems or structures that undermine vision
- Encourage risk-taking and non-traditional ideas
- Address resistors (convince or remove)
- Empower teams to act on vision

**Common Barriers**: Old processes, org structure, legacy systems, resistant leaders

### Step 6: Generate Short-Term Wins
**Goal**: Create visible early successes

**Actions**:
- Plan for and create visible wins (within 6-12 months)
- Celebrate and recognize people involved
- Make wins visible and meaningful
- Build momentum and credibility
- Silence critics with results

**Why Critical**: Proves change is working, builds confidence, justifies costs

### Step 7: Sustain Acceleration
**Goal**: Build on momentum, don't declare victory too early

**Actions**:
- Use credibility from wins to tackle bigger problems
- Bring in fresh change agents and leaders
- Continue removing obstacles
- Maintain urgency
- Keep innovating

**Danger**: Declaring victory prematurely (change regresses)

### Step 8: Institute Change in Culture
**Goal**: Make change stick permanently

**Actions**:
- Articulate connections between behaviors and success
- Ensure leadership demonstrates new behaviors
- Hire and promote people who embody change
- Embed change in systems (processes, policies, metrics)
- Tell success stories repeatedly

**Test**: New employees are onboarded into new way, not old way

## ADKAR Change Model (Individual Level)

- Address fears and concerns
- Connect to values and motivations

### K - Knowledge

**Questions**:
- Do they know what to do differently?
- Do they understand new processes/tools?
- Have they been trained?

**Actions**:
- Comprehensive training programs
- Documentation and job aids
- Mentoring and coaching
- Practice opportunities

### A - Ability

## Managing Resistance

### Understanding Resistance

**Common Reasons for Resistance**:
- Loss of control or status
- Uncertainty and fear of unknown
- Surprise (no involvement or warning)
- Different assessment (disagree with need)
- Loss of face (criticized old way)
- Concerns about competence
- Increased workload
- Past change failures
- Ripple effects on life outside work

### Resistance Patterns

**Active Resistance** (Visible):
- Vocal opposition
- Sabotage
- Forming coalitions against change
- Actively undermining efforts

**Passive Resistance** (Hidden, More Dangerous):
- Agreeing in public, undermining in private
- Malicious compliance
- Withholding information or support
- Absenteeism or disengagement

### Addressing Resistance

**Approach by Root Cause**:

| Root Cause | Solution |
|------------|----------|
| Lack of awareness | Communicate reasons and urgency |
| Lack of desire | Involve in design, address WIIFM |
| Lack of knowledge | Training and education |
| Lack of ability | Coaching, support, remove barriers |
| Lack of reinforcement | Recognition, metrics, consequences |
| Fundamental disagreement | Involve in problem-solving or exit |
| Loss/grief | Acknowledge loss, provide support |

**Four Strategies** (Kotter & Schlesinger):

1. **Education & Communication**: When resistance from lack of info
2. **Participation & Involvement**: When others have expertise and need ownership
3. **Facilitation & Support**: When adjustment difficulties
4. **Negotiation & Agreement**: When clear losers need incentive
5. **Manipulation & Co-optation**: When other tactics won't work (use cautiously)
6. **Explicit & Implicit Coercion**: When speed essential and change leaders have power (last resort)

## Change Communication

### Communication Principles

**7x7 Rule**: Say it 7 times, 7 different ways
- People need to hear message multiple times
- Use different channels and formats
- Repetition creates understanding and buy-in

**Two-Way Communication**:
- Not just broadcasting, but listening
- Town halls with Q&A
- Open forums and feedback channels
- Address concerns and questions
- Adapt message based on feedback

### Communication Plan Components

1. **Key Messages**: 3-5 core messages about change
2. **Audiences**: Different stakeholder groups
3. **Channels**: Email, town halls, 1-on-1s, intranet, videos
4. **Frequency**: Weekly updates minimum during active change
5. **Owners**: Who delivers each message
6. **Feedback Mechanisms**: How people can ask questions and share concerns

### What to Communicate

- **Why**: Business case and urgency
- **What**: Vision and desired future state
- **How**: Implementation plan and timeline
- **Who**: Roles and responsibilities
- **When**: Key milestones and dates
- **Impact**: How it affects different groups
