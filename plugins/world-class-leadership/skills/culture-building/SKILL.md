# Culture Building Excellence

## When to Use This Skill

- Defining or redefining organizational culture
- Embedding values into daily operations
- Addressing culture gaps or dysfunction
- Scaling culture as organization grows
- Post-merger culture integration
- Building specific culture types (innovation, performance, customer-centric)

## Culture Fundamentals

### What is Culture?

**Culture is**:
- Shared values, beliefs, and behaviors
- "How we do things around here"
- What is rewarded, punished, and tolerated
- Behaviors when no one is watching
- Competitive advantage or disadvantage

**Culture is NOT**:
- Posters on walls or words in handbook
- Perks and benefits (ping pong, free lunch)
- One-time events or activities
- What leadership says, but doesn't do

### Culture as Competitive Advantage

**Why Culture Matters**:
- Attracts and retains top talent
- Enables execution and performance
- Drives innovation and adaptability
- Creates consistency at scale
- Differentiates in market
- Sustains success over time

## Defining Your Culture

### Values Definition

**Characteristics of Effective Values**:
- **Memorable**: Easy to recall (3-7 values max)
- **Specific**: Clear what they mean in practice
- **Behavioral**: Observable actions, not aspirations
- **Differentiating**: Unique to your organization
- **Consequential**: Willing to hire/fire based on them

**Avoid Generic Values**:
❌ Integrity, Innovation, Teamwork, Excellence, Respect
✅ "Freedom & Responsibility" (Netflix), "Customer Obsession" (Amazon)

### Culture Framework Examples

**Netflix Culture: Freedom & Responsibility**
- Context not control
- Highly aligned, loosely coupled
- Freedom to make decisions
- Responsible for outcomes
- No vacation or expense policies
- Pay top of market
- Keeper test for all employees

**Amazon Leadership Principles**
- 14 specific principles (Customer Obsession to Deliver Results)
- Used in hiring, performance, decisions
- Behavioral interview questions
- Referenced constantly in daily work
- Part of company language

**Zappos Core Values**
- Deliver WOW through service
- Embrace and drive change
- Create fun and a little weirdness
- Be adventurous, creative, and open-minded
- Cultural fit is hiring requirement
- Will pay to quit if not culture fit

### Values Translation to Behaviors

**Turn values into observable behaviors**:

| Value | Behaviors |
|-------|-----------|
| Customer Obsession | - Start with customer, work backward<br>- Spend time with customers weekly<br>- Use customer feedback in every decision<br>- Measure customer satisfaction relentlessly |
| Ownership | - Think long-term<br>- Act on behalf of entire company<br>- Never say "that's not my job"<br>- See problems through to resolution |
| Innovation | - Experiment and fail fast<br>- Challenge status quo<br>- Seek diverse perspectives<br>- Allocate time for exploration |

## Embedding Culture

### Hire for Culture

**Culture Fit Interview**:
- Assess values alignment, not just skills
- Behavioral questions testing values
- Case studies revealing decision-making
- Team interviews to assess fit
- Red flags on values violations = no hire

**Example Questions** (Testing "Ownership"):
- "Tell me about a time you went above and beyond your job description"
- "Describe a situation where you saw a problem outside your area and took action"
- "How do you respond when someone says 'that's not my job'?"

**Zappos Approach**:
- Cultural fit interview separate from role interview
- Both must pass
- Offer $2000 to quit after onboarding if not fit

### Onboard for Culture

**Culture Immersion**:
- Day 1: Culture and values training
- Share company story and mission
- Explain values with real examples
- Meet founders or senior leaders
- Buddy system with culture ambassadors
- 30-60-90 day culture check-ins

**Amazon Approach**:
- All employees (including VPs) start in customer service
- Experience customer pain points
- Embeds customer obsession from day one

### Reinforce in Performance Management

**What Gets Measured Gets Done**:
- Evaluate "what" AND "how" equally
- 360 feedback on values demonstration
- Values component in every review
- Promotion requires values excellence
- No tolerance for "brilliant jerks"

**Netflix "Keeper Test"**:
- Would we fight to keep this person?
- If not, give generous severance
- High performers who violate values don't stay
- Keep only "stunning colleagues"

### Recognize and Reward

**Recognition Programs**:
- Spot awards for values demonstration
