# AWS Platform Strategy Case Study

## Overview

**Launch**: 2006
**Current Scale**: $90B+ annual revenue (2023), 33% cloud market share

## Platform Strategy

### The Primitives Approach

**Philosophy**: Provide building blocks, not complete solutions

**Examples**:
- EC2 (compute primitive) vs managed app hosting

- VPC (networking primitive) vs managed network

**Benefits**:
- Flexibility for developers
- Composability (mix and match)
- Innovation at edges (customers build on primitives)

More services → More use cases → More customers →
More revenue → Fund more services → (loop)
```
