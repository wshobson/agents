# AI Product Strategy

## When to Use This Skill

- Building LLM-powered features
- Designing generative AI products
- Planning AI product roadmap
- Implementing responsible AI
- Optimizing prompt engineering
- Evaluating AI model performance
- AI cost optimization

## Core Frameworks

### Anthropic's Constitutional AI
- Helpfulness, harmlessness, honesty
- Self-critique and improvement
- Safety-first design

### OpenAI's Iterative Deployment
- Research preview → Controlled rollout → Public release
- Safety mechanisms and monitoring
- Continuous improvement

### Google's AI Principles
