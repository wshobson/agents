# Product Discovery Frameworks

## 1. Continuous Discovery Habits (Teresa Torres)

### Weekly Touchpoints with Customers

**Structure**:
- Interview 1-2 customers every week
- Observe users in their environment
- Test prototypes and gather feedback

**Benefits**:
- Stay connected to user reality
- Validate assumptions continuously
- Discover unmet needs early

---

## 2. Opportunity Solution Tree

**Framework**:
```
Desired Outcome (Business Goal)
    ↓
Opportunities (User Problems/Needs)
    ↓
Solutions (How to solve)
    ↓
Experiments (Tests to validate)
```

**Example**:
```
Outcome: Increase user retention to 60%
    ├─ Opportunity: Users forget to log in
    │   ├─ Solution: Email reminders
    │   │   └─ Experiment: A/B test reminder frequency
    │   └─ Solution: Mobile app push notifications
    │       └─ Experiment: Test notification triggers
    └─ Opportunity: Users don't see value quickly
        └─ Solution: Guided onboarding
            └─ Experiment: Test different flows
```

## 3. Dual-Track Agile

**Two Parallel Tracks**:

**Discovery Track**:
- Product manager + designer
- Customer interviews, prototyping
- Validate problems and solutions
- Output: Validated ideas ready for delivery

**Delivery Track**:
- Full team (PM, eng, design)
- Build validated ideas
- Ship to production
- Output: Working software

**Benefits**:
- Always have validated backlog
- Reduce waste (build only validated features)
- Continuous learning

## 4. Assumption Mapping

**Process**:
1. List all assumptions about user, market, solution
2. Rank by importance (critical vs nice-to-know)
3. Rank by evidence (unknown vs proven)
4. Test high-importance + low-evidence assumptions first

**Matrix**:
```
        Known      Unknown
Important  [✓]      [TEST FIRST]
Minor      [✓]      [TEST LATER]
```

## 5. Prototype Testing Ladder

**Progression**:
1. **Sketches**: Hand-drawn mockups (1 hour)
2. **Wireframes**: Low-fidelity digital (4 hours)
3. **Clickable Prototype**: Interactive (1 day)
4. **MVP**: Minimal working product (1 week)
5. **Beta**: Limited release (1 month)

**When to Use Each**:
- Sketches: Initial concept validation
- Wireframes: User flow testing
- Clickable: Usability testing
- MVP: Value proposition validation
- Beta: Scale and performance testing

## 6. Concierge MVP

**Concept**: Manually deliver service before building product

**Example**:
- Food delivery app: Manually take orders, deliver food
- Validates: Demand, pricing, logistics
- Before building: App, driver network, restaurant integrations

**Benefits**:
- Learn customer needs deeply
- Validate willingness to pay
- Low upfront investment

---

## 7. Wizard of Oz Testing

**Concept**: Fake automation with humans behind scenes

**Example**:
- Chatbot: Human responds, appears automated
- AI feature: Manual curation appears algorithmic

**Benefits**:
- Test UX before building tech
- Validate user behavior
- Learn edge cases
