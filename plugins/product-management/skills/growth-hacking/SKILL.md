# Growth Hacking

## When to Use This Skill

- Designing viral loops and referral programs
- Optimizing conversion funnels
- Running growth experiments (A/B tests)
- Analyzing cohort retention
- Building growth models
- Scaling user acquisition
- Optimizing monetization

## Core Frameworks

### AARRR Metrics (Dave McClure)
- **Acquisition**: Traffic sources, CAC
- **Activation**: Aha moment, onboarding
- **Retention**: D7/D30 cohorts, churn
- **Referral**: Viral coefficient, k-factor
- **Revenue**: ARPU, LTV, conversion

### North Star Framework
- Single metric representing value
- Input metrics (drivers)
- Work streams (initiatives)

### Growth Accounting (Facebook)
```
MAU(t) = MAU(t-1) + New + Resurrected - Churned
Quick Ratio = (New + Resurrected) / Churned
```

## Key Patterns

### Viral Loops
- Double-sided referrals (Dropbox)
- Network invitations (LinkedIn)
- Content sharing (Pinterest)
- Marketplace dynamics (Uber, Airbnb)

### Activation Optimization
- Magic numbers (Facebook: 7 friends)
- Aha moments (Slack: 2K messages)
- Onboarding flows
- Quick wins

### Retention Mechanics
- Habit loops (Duolingo streaks)
- Notifications (re-engagement)
- Gamification (points, badges)
- Network effects (more users = more value)
