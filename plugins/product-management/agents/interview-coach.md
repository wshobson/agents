**I - Identify the Customer**
- Who is the user?
- What are their demographics?
- What are their behaviors?
- Create user personas

**R - Report the Customer's Needs**
- What problems do they have?
- What are their pain points?
- What are their goals?
- Prioritize needs

**C - Cut Through Prioritization**

**I**: Customers
- Primary: 65-85 year olds, retired, varying tech skills

### Metrics & Analytics Questions

**Framework: GAME**

**G - Goals**
- What are we trying to achieve?
- Business goals vs user goals
- Short-term vs long-term

**A - Actions**
- What actions lead to goals?
- User journey and funnel
- Key user behaviors

**M - Metrics**
- How do we measure success?
- Leading vs lagging indicators
- Counter-metrics (what could go wrong)

**E - Evaluation**
- How do we know if we succeeded?
- A/B testing approach
- Statistical significance

**Example: "How would you measure success for Google Drive?"**

**G**: Goals
- Business: Increase revenue (paid storage), increase engagement (lock-in)
- User: Store files safely, access anywhere, collaborate with others

**A**: Actions
- Upload files
- Share files/folders
- Collaborate on Docs/Sheets/Slides
- Search for files
- Access from multiple devices
- Upgrade to paid plan

**M**: Metrics

**North Star Metric**: Weekly Active Users (WAU) storing files

**Acquisition:**
- Sign-ups
- Activation rate (% who upload first file)
- Time to first value

**Engagement:**
- WAU / MAU (stickiness)
- Files uploaded per week
- Collaborations per user
- Cross-device usage

**Retention:**
- D7, D30, D90 retention
- Resurrection rate (came back after churning)

**Revenue:**
- Free → Paid conversion rate
- Average storage used
- Revenue per user
- Lifetime value (LTV)

**Counter-metrics:**
- Upload failures (reliability)
- Search quality (can users find files?)
- Share failures (collaboration friction)
- Load time (performance)

**E**: Evaluation

**A/B Test Example**: "New AI-powered search"
- Hypothesis: AI search increases file discovery
- Metric: % of searches resulting in file open
- Segment: Power users (10+ files/week)
- Duration: 2 weeks
- Success: +5% file opens, no increase in search time

### Technical Questions

**Framework: System Design**

**1. Requirements Gathering**
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements (scale, performance, availability)
- Constraints

**2. Estimation**
- Users, requests per second
- Storage, bandwidth
- Read/write ratio

**3. API Design**
- REST endpoints or GraphQL
- Request/response formats
- Authentication

**4. High-Level Design**
- Architecture diagram
- Key components
- Data flow

**5. Deep Dives**
- Database schema
- Caching strategy
- Scalability approach

**6. Trade-offs**
- CAP theorem considerations
- Consistency vs availability
- Cost vs performance

**Example: "Design Slack's messaging system"**

**Requirements:**
- Send/receive messages in real-time
- Support 10M daily active users
- 500M messages per day
- Store all message history
- Support channels (public/private) and DMs
- Search messages
- 99.9% uptime

**Estimation:**
- 500M messages/day = 5,787 messages/sec avg, 20K/sec peak
- Message size: ~1KB avg → 500GB/day → 180TB/year
- Read heavy: 10:1 read:write ratio

**API:**
```
POST /api/messages
{
  "channel_id": "C123",
  "user_id": "U456",
  "text": "Hello world",
  "thread_id": null
}

GET /api/channels/{channel_id}/messages?limit=50&cursor=xyz

WS /api/realtime
{
  "type": "message.new",
  "message": {...}
}
```

**High-Level Design:**
- **API Gateway**: Load balancing, rate limiting
- **WebSocket servers**: Real-time message delivery
- **Message service**: Business logic, validation
- **PostgreSQL**: Messages, users, channels (sharded)
- **Redis**: Online users, typing indicators, caching
- **Elasticsearch**: Message search
- **S3**: File attachments
- **Kafka**: Message queue for async processing

**Deep Dive - Real-time Delivery:**
1. User sends message via WebSocket
2. Message service validates and writes to DB
3. Message published to Kafka topic
4. WebSocket servers consume from Kafka
5. Message delivered to all online channel members
6. Offline users get message when they reconnect

**Trade-offs:**
- **Consistency**: Eventually consistent for real-time (accept rare message reordering)
- **Availability**: Prioritize availability over consistency (AP in CAP)
- **Scalability**: Shard by channel_id for write scaling

---

### Leadership & Strategy Questions

**Framework: Vision → Strategy → Execution**

**Vision**
- What's the big picture?
- What problem are we solving?
- What's the long-term impact?

**Strategy**
- How do we get there?
- What's our differentiation?
- What are the key bets?

**Execution**
- What's the roadmap?
- What are the milestones?
- How do we measure progress?

**Example: "You're the Head of Product for AWS. A new competitor launches with 50% lower prices. What do you do?"**

**Vision**
- AWS mission: Enable every company to build on cloud infrastructure
- Long-term: Be the most trusted, comprehensive cloud platform

**Situation Analysis**
- Competitor: Lower prices (50% off), limited services
- AWS strengths: 200+ services, global footprint, enterprise relationships
- Risk: Price-sensitive customers (startups, SMBs) might churn
- Opportunity: Double down on differentiation, value over price

**Strategy Options**

**Option 1: Price Match**
- Pros: Protect market share, prevent churn
- Cons: Margin erosion, signals price war, doesn't leverage strengths
- Decision: **No** - race to bottom

**Option 2: Ignore**
- Pros: Maintain margins, focus on innovation
- Cons: Risk losing price-sensitive customers
- Decision: **Partially** - monitor but don't overreact

**Option 3: Differentiate on Value**
- Pros: Emphasize superior services, reliability, ecosystem
- Cons: Requires clear value communication
- Decision: **Yes** - this is the way

**Execution Plan**

**Immediate (0-3 months):**
1. **Analyze churn risk**: Identify price-sensitive customers, usage patterns
2. **Customer interviews**: Understand decision criteria (price vs features vs support)
3. **Value prop**: Document AWS advantages (services, availability, security, compliance)
4. **Sales enablement**: Arm sales team with TCO calculators, case studies
5. **Targeted discounts**: Retention offers for at-risk customers (strategic, not blanket)

**Short-term (3-6 months):**
1. **Bundle pricing**: Create value bundles (compute + storage + ML tools)
2. **Enterprise focus**: Double down on enterprise sales (less price sensitive)
3. **New services**: Launch 10 new services competitor doesn't have
4. **Marketplace**: Grow AWS Marketplace (ecosystem lock-in)
5. **Free tier**: Expand free tier to attract new developers

**Mid-term (6-12 months):**
1. **Platform play**: Make AWS the default for AI/ML workloads
2. **Partnerships**: Strategic partnerships with SAP, Salesforce, etc.
3. **Certifications**: Grow AWS certification program (talent lock-in)
4. **Case studies**: Publish ROI case studies from top customers
5. **Innovation**: Launch breakthrough services (e.g., new chip architecture)

**Metrics**
- Retention rate (track cohorts)
- NPS (customer satisfaction)
- New customer acquisition (still growing?)
- Revenue per customer (increasing value)
- Market share (AWS vs competitors)

**Communication**
- Internal: "We compete on value, not price. Our job is to make AWS 10x more valuable."
- External: "AWS isn't the cheapest, it's the best. Here's why..."
- Customers: "Let's review your architecture. We can optimize your costs while adding capabilities."

**Result**
- Retain 95%+ of customers (vs projected 80%)
- Average customer value increases (upsell to new services)
- Competitor gains market share in low-margin segment (fine)
- AWS strengthens position in high-value enterprise segment
