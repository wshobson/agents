# Product-Led Growth (PLG) Tactics

## Когда использовать

- Transitioning от sales-led к product-led motion
- Designing freemium или free trial models
- Building viral loops в продукт
- Optimizing self-serve onboarding
- Creating usage-based expansion engines
- Reducing CAC через product virality

## Ключевые концепции

### PLG Fundamentals

**Definition**: Product = primary driver роста, acquisition и expansion (не sales team)

**Core Principles:**
```
1. Let users experience value before paying (free tier/trial)
2. Self-serve signup (no sales call required)
3. Time-to-value < 5 minutes (aha moment fast)
4. Product teaches itself (in-app guidance)
5. Viral by design (collaboration = distribution)
6. Usage-based pricing (align cost with value)
```

### PLG Flywheel

```
   Start Free/Trial
         ↓
   Experience Value ←──────┐
         ↓                 │
   Invite Team            │
         ↓                 │
   Increase Usage         │
         ↓                 │
   Expand/Upgrade         │
         ↓                 │

## PLG Models от Industry Leaders

### 1. Slack Model: Network Effects PLG

**Motion**: Team → Department → Company-Wide

```
Step 1: Free Team Signup (10 members free)
- Instant workspace creation
- No credit card required
- Full features, limited history (10K messages)

Step 2: Organic Growth Within Team
- Invite teammates (viral loop #1)
- Integrate tools (switching cost increases)
- Form habits (daily usage)

Step 3: Hit Limits (Conversion Trigger)
- 10K messages archived (need history)
- Advanced features needed (SSO, analytics)
- Compliance requirements (data retention)

Step 4: Paid Conversion
- Self-serve upgrade ($X per user/month)
- Or sales for enterprise (volume discount)

Step 5: Expand Within Company
- Other teams see usage (viral loop #2)
- Company-wide adoption
- Enterprise plan (thousands of users)

Magic Number: 2,000 team messages = permanent retention
```

**Why It Works:**
- ✅ Network effects (more team = more value)
- ✅ Data lock-in (history becomes valuable)
- ✅ Habit formation (daily use)
- ✅ Bottom-up adoption (no executive buy-in needed)

### 2. Notion Model: Content-Led PLG

**Motion**: Individual → Team → Community

```
Step 1: Personal Use (Free Forever)
- Templates gallery (inspiration)
- Unlimited blocks (generous free tier)
- Cross-platform (web, mobile, desktop)

Step 2: Public Sharing (Viral Loop)
- Share templates publicly
- Other users discover & clone
- Backlink to Notion (SEO benefit)

Step 3: Collaboration Unlock (Conversion Trigger)
- Invite team members (need paid)
- Advanced permissions
- Team workspaces

Step 4: Community Amplification
- Notion ambassadors program
- Template marketplace (user-generated)
- Social media showcase (#NotionSetup)

Result: 30M+ users, $10B valuation (minimal sales team)
```

**Why It Works:**
- ✅ User-generated content = marketing
- ✅ Templates = virality + onboarding
- ✅ Public sharing = SEO + discovery
- ✅ Community-led growth

### 3. Figma Model: Real-Time Collaboration PLG

**Motion**: Designer → Design Team → Entire Product Org

```
Step 1: Free Designer (3 files free)
- Browser-based (no download)
- Real-time multiplayer
- View-only links (free viewers unlimited)

Step 2: Collaboration Magic (Viral Loop)
- Designers share links with stakeholders
- Stakeholders comment (free, but exposed to Figma)
- Developers inspect specs (free viewer mode)
- PMs review designs (free observer)

Step 3: Network Effect Expansion
- More stakeholders = more team adoption
- Free viewers become paid creators
- Cross-team collaboration

Step 4: Organization-Wide Adoption
- Design system libraries (team dependency)
- Plugins ecosystem (switching cost)
- Enterprise plan (SSO, advanced admin)

Magic: Multiplayer as core feature = built-in virality
```

**Why It Works:**
- ✅ Viewers are free (no friction to share)
- ✅ Real-time = "wow" experience
- ✅ Cross-functional (not just designers)
- ✅ Browser-based (zero install friction)

### 4. Dropbox Model: Storage-Incentivized Referral

**Motion**: Individual → Viral Referral Program

```
Step 1: Free Storage (2GB)
- Simple, clear value prop
- Desktop app (automatic sync)
- Cross-device access

Step 2: Hit Storage Limit (Pain Point)
- "You're running out of space"
- Options: Delete files, pay, or refer

Step 3: Referral Incentive (Viral Mechanism)
- Refer friend → +500MB (both sides)
- Social sharing (Facebook, Twitter, email)
- Maximum: +16GB through referrals

Result: 4M → 100M users in 15 months (3900% growth)
Growth attribution: 35% direct referrals

Step 4: Paid Conversion
- Still need more space → Dropbox Plus
- Business users → Dropbox Business
```

**Why It Works:**
- ✅ Double-sided incentive (both benefit)
- ✅ Built into product (not external)
- ✅ Immediate gratification (instant storage)
- ✅ Aligned with pain point (need more space)

### 5. Calendly Model: Embedded Virality

**Motion**: Individual → Every Meeting Invitee

```
Step 1: Free Individual (Forever free)
- One meeting type
- Unlimited bookings
- Calendar integration

Step 2: Every Meeting = Ad (Viral Loop)
- Booking link shared → "Powered by Calendly"
- Confirmation email → Calendly branding
- Recipient sees ease of use
- Recipient signs up for own account

Step 3: Team Adoption
- Multiple users in company adopt
- Need team features (round-robin, routing)
- Upgrade to paid team plan

Viral Coefficient: ~1.2 (each user brings 1.2 new users)
```

**Why It Works:**
- ✅ Every use = exposure to new user
- ✅ Recipient experiences value (easier scheduling)
- ✅ "Powered by" drives brand awareness
- ✅ Product sells itself

## PLG Activation Playbook

### Aha Moment Identification

**Framework:**
```
1. Analyze retained vs churned users
2. Identify behavioral differences
3. Find earliest predictor of retention
4. Define as "aha moment"
5. Optimize to reach faster
```

**Famous Aha Moments:**
- **Facebook**: 7 friends in 10 days
- **Slack**: 2,000 team messages
- **Dropbox**: 1 file in 1 folder on 1 device
- **LinkedIn**: 4 connections made
- **Twitter**: Following 30 users
- **Airbnb**: 1 booking completed

### Time-to-Value Optimization

**Benchmark Targets:**
```
Consumer apps: < 30 seconds to value
Horizontal SaaS: < 5 minutes to aha moment
Vertical SaaS: < 15 minutes to first workflow
Developer tools: < 7 minutes to first API call
```

**Tactics:**
```
1. Remove signup friction
   - Social login (Google, GitHub)
   - Postpone email verification
   - Skip unnecessary fields

2. Start with value, not setup
   - Pre-populated data (templates, examples)
   - Skip configuration wizard
   - Show working example first

3. Progressive disclosure
   - Don't show all features upfront
   - Reveal complexity gradually
   - Contextual help (when needed)

4. Interactive tutorials
   - Hands-on > video walkthroughs
   - Product tours (Appcues, Pendo)
   - Celebrate small wins
```

## Freemium vs Free Trial Strategy

### Freemium (Forever Free Tier)

**When to Use:**
- Network effects important (Slack, Figma)
- Viral sharing built-in (Calendly, Notion)
- Usage-based expansion (grow with customer)
- Long decision cycles (need time to adopt)

**Design Principles:**
```
Good Freemium:
✅ Useful forever (not crippled trial)
✅ Upgrade path clear (hit natural limits)
✅ Viral mechanics (sharing = acquisition)

Bad Freemium:
❌ Too generous (never need to upgrade)
❌ Feature-limited (can't experience value)
❌ Confusing tiers (don't understand difference)
```

**Example: Notion**
```
Free:
- Unlimited blocks (generous!)
- All features (can experience value)
- Limit: Collaboration (5 guests, no team workspace)

Paid ($8/user/month):
- Unlimited team members
- Advanced permissions
- Version history (30 days → unlimited)

Why it works: Free is useful solo, paid unlocks team
```

### Free Trial (Time-Limited)

**When to Use:**
- High-touch onboarding needed (complex products)
- Enterprise features differentiate (security, SSO)
- Sales involvement valuable (consultative)
- Credit card up-front acceptable

**Design Principles:**
```
Trial Duration:
- 7 days: Simple, transactional products
- 14 days: Standard SaaS (most common)
- 30 days: Complex, enterprise products
- Custom: POC for large deals

During Trial:
- Day 1: Welcome email + onboarding
- Day 3: Check-in (need help?)
- Day 7: Mid-trial (success stories)
- Day 12: Reminder (2 days left)
- Day 14: Last chance (upgrade prompt)
- Day 15: Downgrade or convert
```

**Example: Netflix**
```
30-Day Free Trial:
- Credit card required (reduces fraud)
- Full access (all content, HD, devices)
- Cancel anytime (no penalty)
- Conversion ~80% (exceptional)

Why it works: Content quality + habit formation
```

## Viral Loop Design

### Types of Virality

**1. Inherent Virality** (Product = Distribution)
```
Examples:
- Zoom: Free participants in meetings
- Figma: Unlimited viewers on files
- WhatsApp: Can only message other users

Formula: Product requires multiple users
```

**2. Collaboration Virality** (Invites = Growth)
```
Examples:
- Slack: Invite teammates
- Notion: Share workspace
- Asana: Add team members

Formula: Product better with team
```

**3. Content Virality** (Sharing = Marketing)
```
Examples:
- Canva: "Made with Canva" watermark
- Medium: Cross-posting to social
- TikTok: Watermark on downloaded videos

Formula: User-generated content has branding
```

**4. Incentivized Virality** (Rewards = Referrals)
```
Examples:
- Dropbox: Extra storage for referrals
- Airbnb: Travel credits for both sides
- Uber: Ride credits for referrals

Formula: Both sides benefit from referral
```

### Viral Coefficient Calculation

```
K = i × c

где:
i = invitations per user
c = conversion rate of invitations

K > 1 = Viral growth (exponential)
K < 1 = Still good (free acquisition)

Example (Dropbox):
i = 5 invitations per user
c = 20% conversion
K = 5 × 0.2 = 1.0 (break-even virality)

But: Short cycle time (hours, not weeks)
→ Exponential growth even at K=1
```
