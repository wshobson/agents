4. Any concerns that almost prevented the deal?
5. How was the buying process? Improvements?

**For Losses:**
1. Who did you choose? Why?
2. Where did we fall short?
3. What could we have done differently?
4. Would you reconsider us in the future? Under what conditions?
5. Any advice for us?

**Analysis:**
- Tag themes (price, features, support, trust, etc.)
- Quantify frequency of each theme
- Competitive patterns (consistent wins/losses vs specific competitor)
- Trend analysis (improving/declining over time)

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Trap Setting

**Definition**: Создание evaluation criteria, где вы объективно stronger

**Example от AWS:**
```
Instead of: "Do you need cloud services?"
Trap setting: "How important is having 200+ services for future flexibility vs 50 services?"

Result: AWS (200+ services) vs Google Cloud (50+) → positions AWS strength
```

**Your Trap Questions:**
1. Identify your unique strength
2. Craft question that reveals gap
3. Train sales to ask early in discovery
4. Use answer to position your advantage

### 2. Competitive Displacement Strategy

**Targeting Competitor's Customers:**

**Phase 1: Identify Unhappy Customers**
- G2 reviews (filter 3-star reviews)
- Social media complaints
- Support forum frustrations
- Churned customer intel

**Phase 2: Understand Pain Points**
- Why are they unhappy?
- What would make them switch?
- Switching costs (technical, financial, political)

**Phase 3: Targeted Campaign**
- "Switch from X" landing page
- Migration guides & tools
- Competitive upgrade offers
- Fast-track implementation

**Phase 4: Prove Value Quickly**
- 30-day value demonstration
- Side-by-side comparison reports
- Quick wins documentation

### 3. Defensive Strategy

**When Competitor Targets Your Customers:**

**Early Warning Signals:**
- Customer engagement drops
- Evaluation questions about competitor
- Pricing questions / discount requests
- Reduced adoption of new features

**Response Playbook:**
1. **Executive check-in**: C-level to C-level
2. **Value review**: QBR showing ROI achieved
3. **Roadmap preview**: Future innovations aligned to their needs
4. **Customer advocacy**: Peer references, case study spotlight
5. **Pricing adjustment**: Renewal discount if needed
