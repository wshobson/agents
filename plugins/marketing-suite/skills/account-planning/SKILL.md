        └────┬─────┘
             │
     ┌───────┴───────┐
     │               │
┌────▼─────┐   ┌────▼─────┐
│   CFO    │   │   CTO    │ ← Economic & Technical Buyers

│ Director │   │          │ ← Champion (your advocate)
└──────────┘   └────┬─────┘
                    │

                    ┌─────▼──────┐
                    │ Engineers  │ ← End Users
                    │ (ICs)      │

### Multi-Threading Strategy

**Coverage Scoring:**
```
Minimal (1-2 contacts): 🔴 High risk
- Single point of failure
- No organizational buy-in

Developing (3-4 contacts): 🟡 Moderate risk
- Some coverage but gaps remain
- Need executive and end-user engagement

Strong (5-6 contacts): 🟢 Good position
- Key personas engaged
- Organizational awareness

Excellent (7+ contacts): 🟢🟢 Winning position
- Full committee coverage
- Multiple champions
- Executive sponsorship secured
```

**Multi-Threading Tactics:**
1. **Discovery expansion**: "Who else should be involved in this decision?"
2. **Stakeholder interviews**: Request to speak with technical/business stakeholders
3. **Executive alignment**: AE requests C-level meeting
4. **Workshop approach**: Invite multiple personas to solution workshops
