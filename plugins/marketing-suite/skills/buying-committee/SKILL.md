## Ключевые концепции

### Типичный Enterprise Buying Committee

```
Economic Buyer (CFO/CEO): Budget authority
Technical Buyer (CTO/VP Eng): Technical veto
Champion (Director/Manager): Internal advocate
Influencers (Architects/ICs): Technical input
Blocker (Incumbent vendor fan): Resistance
End Users (ICs): Daily users
```

### MEDDIC Framework

**M**etrics: Quantifiable business value
**E**conomic Buyer: Who has budget authority
**D**ecision Criteria: How they'll choose
**D**ecision Process: Steps in buying process
**I**dentify Pain: Critical business problem
**C**hampion: Internal advocate for your solution

### Multi-Threading Strategy

**Coverage Levels:**
- **1-2 contacts**: 🔴 Single-threaded (high risk)
- **3-4 contacts**: 🟡 Developing
- **5-6 contacts**: 🟢 Good coverage
- **7+ contacts**: 🟢🟢 Excellent (organizational buy-in)

**Tactics:**
1. Champion development
2. Executive sponsorship (C-level to C-level)
3. Technical validation (SE/SA engagement)
4. End-user trials (bottom-up adoption)
5. Business case building (CFO alignment)

## Stakeholder Mapping
