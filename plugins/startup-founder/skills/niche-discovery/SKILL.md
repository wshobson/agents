# Niche Discovery

## When to Use This Skill

- Searching for startup ideas and market opportunities
- Evaluating multiple potential niches
- Selecting a beachhead market to target first
- Validating that a niche is large and growing enough
- Finding underserved or emerging market segments
- Pivoting to a new market opportunity

## Core Concepts

### What Makes a Great Niche?

**The Ideal Niche Characteristics:**

1. **Large Enough to Matter**
   - $1B+ TAM (Total Addressable Market)
   - Growing 20%+ annually
   - Path to $100M+ revenue possible

2. **Accessible to You**
   - Can reach customers cost-effectively
   - Have domain expertise or can gain it
   - Network or distribution advantage exists

3. **Has Clear Pain**
   - Customers actively looking for solutions
   - Willing to pay to solve the problem
   - Problem is urgent, not just nice-to-have

4. **Defensible**
   - Potential for moats (network effects, data, brand)
   - Not easily copied by incumbents
   - Barriers to entry for competitors

5. **Aligned with Trends**
   - Riding macro tailwinds (not headwinds)
   - Technology or behavioral shifts enabling
   - Regulatory or policy support (not opposition)

### The Niche Discovery Process

```
Phase 1: Divergent Thinking (Generate Ideas)
- Brainstorm 50-100 potential niches
- No filtering yet, quantity over quality
- Use multiple idea generation techniques

Phase 2: Initial Filter (Narrow to 10-15)
- Apply basic criteria (market size, growth)
- Remove obvious non-starters
- Keep anything promising

Phase 3: Deep Research (Validate Top 5)
- Market sizing and analysis
- Customer interviews
- Competitive landscape
- Economic model feasibility

Phase 4: Selection (Choose Beachhead)
- Score and rank opportunities
- Select primary focus
- Define backup options

Phase 5: Validation (Test Assumptions)
- Build landing page or prototype
- Run small paid ads test
- Conduct customer development
- Measure interest and willingness to pay
```

## Idea Generation Techniques

### 1. Problem-First Approach

**Start with Problems You've Experienced:**
```
Questions to ask:
- What frustrates me in my daily work?
- What manual processes take too much time?
- What products do I use that are terrible?
- What do I complain about regularly?
- What would I pay to make easier?

Example: Drew Houston (Dropbox)
- Kept forgetting USB drive with files
- File syncing across devices was painful
- Built Dropbox to solve his own problem
```

**Talk to People in Your Network:**
```
Questions to ask them:
- What's the most frustrating part of your job?
- What takes way longer than it should?
- What software do you wish existed?
- What would save you 5+ hours per week?
- What would you pay $100/month for?

Run 20-30 of these conversations
Look for patterns in complaints
```

### 2. Trend-Spotting Approach

**Technology Trends:**
- AI/ML becoming accessible
- Voice interfaces proliferating
- Edge computing expanding
- Web3 and blockchain maturing
- AR/VR becoming mainstream
- No-code tools enabling non-technical builders

**Ask: "What becomes possible with this new technology?"**

```
Example: Stripe
Trend: APIs becoming standard for payments
Insight: Developers need simple payment integration
Result: $95B company
```

**Behavioral Trends:**
- Remote work normalization
- Creator economy growth
- Subscription fatigue
- Privacy consciousness
- Wellness prioritization
- Sustainability demands

**Ask: "What new problems does this behavior create?"**

### 3. Industry Analysis Approach

**Pick 5-10 Industries:**
- Healthcare
- Financial services
- Education
- Real estate
- Logistics
- Legal
- Manufacturing
- Agriculture

**Research Each:**
- Industry size and growth rate
- Major pain points and inefficiencies
- Level of digitization (less = more opportunity)
- Regulatory environment
- Incumbent solutions (old/bad = opportunity)

**Look For:**
- Industries with legacy technology
- High fragmentation (many small players)
- Regulatory changes creating opportunities
- Underserved segments

```
Example: Gusto
Industry: Payroll and HR
Insight: Existing solutions (ADP, Paychex) were enterprise-focused
Opportunity: Modern, simple payroll for SMBs
Result: $10B+ valuation
```

### 4. Jobs-to-be-Done Approach

**Framework:** People "hire" products to do a job

**Job Mapping:**
```
1. Define the core job
   Example: "Get from point A to B in the city"

2. Break down into steps
   - Call for ride
   - Wait for pickup
   - Take ride
   - Pay for ride
   - Rate experience

3. Identify pain points at each step
   - Calling a cab is annoying (pre-Uber)
   - Don't know when it will arrive
   - Payment is complicated
   - Quality is inconsistent

4. Look for opportunities to improve
   Result: Uber/Lyft
```

**Jobs in Different Contexts:**
- Functional jobs (tasks to complete)
- Social jobs (how they want to be perceived)
- Emotional jobs (how they want to feel)

### 5. Underserved Segment Approach

**Big Market → Find Underserved Segment**

```
Example Process:

Large market: CRM software ($50B+)
Existing solutions: Salesforce (enterprise), HubSpot (mid-market)

Underserved segments:
- Real estate agents → Close.com
- Sales teams at startups → Pipedrive
- Solo entrepreneurs → Streak (CRM in Gmail)
- Non-profits → Bloomerang

Pick segment where you have:
- Domain expertise
- Network to reach them
- Understanding of unique needs
```

**How to Find Underserved Segments:**
1. Look at who complains about existing solutions
2. Find users with unique workflows
3. Identify industries not well-served
4. Find geographic markets being ignored
5. Look for demographic groups overlooked

## Market Sizing Framework

### Three Methods for TAM Calculation

**1. Top-Down (Market Research)**
```
Sources:
- Gartner, Forrester reports
- IBISWorld industry reports
- CB Insights market maps
- Public company investor decks

Example: Project Management Software
- Global market: $6B (Gartner)
- Growing at 10% annually
- Our target segment: SMBs (40% = $2.4B)

Weakness: Often too broad and generic
```

**2. Bottom-Up (Unit Economics)**
```
Formula:
# of potential customers × average revenue per customer

Example: Accounting Software for Dentists
- 200,000 dental practices in US
- Average spend: $200/month on software
- TAM: 200,000 × $200 × 12 = $480M annually

Strength: More accurate and investor-credible
```

**3. Value-Based (Problem Cost)**
```
Formula:
Cost of problem × # of affected entities

Example: Inventory Management for Restaurants
- 660,000 restaurants in US
- Average loss from poor inventory: $50K/year
- TAM: 660,000 × $50,000 = $33B problem

Strength: Shows urgency and willingness to pay
```

### TAM, SAM, SOM Framework

```
TAM (Total Addressable Market):
- The total market demand for a product/service
- Maximum revenue opportunity if you had 100% share
- Example: All spending on transportation globally

SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):
- The portion you can reach with your product
- Segment of TAM within your reach
- Example: Ride-sharing in major US cities

SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):
- The portion you can realistically capture
- Your beachhead market opportunity
- Example: Ride-sharing in San Francisco in year 1

Investor Expectation:
- TAM: $1B+ (venture scale)
- SAM: $100M-500M (big enough to matter)
- SOM: $10M-50M in 3-5 years (achievable)
```

## Market Evaluation Criteria

### The Opportunity Scorecard

Rate each niche 1-10 on these dimensions:

**Market Attractiveness (40 points)**
1. Market Size (TAM >$1B = 10, <$100M = 1)
2. Growth Rate (>30% = 10, <5% = 1)
3. Market Maturity (emerging = 10, saturated = 1)
4. Margin Potential (>80% gross margin = 10, <20% = 1)

**Competitive Landscape (20 points)**
5. Competition Intensity (low = 10, intense = 1)
6. Incumbent Vulnerability (weak = 10, strong = 1)

**Accessibility (20 points)**
7. Customer Reach (easy = 10, hard = 1)
8. Sales Cycle (short = 10, long = 1)

**Founder Fit (20 points)**
9. Domain Expertise (expert = 10, novice = 1)
10. Passion/Commitment (high = 10, low = 1)

**Scoring:**
- 80-100: Excellent opportunity, pursue
- 60-79: Good opportunity, validate further
- 40-59: Mediocre, consider alternatives
- <40: Weak opportunity, skip

### Red Flags to Avoid

**Market Red Flags:**
❌ Shrinking or flat market
❌ TAM <$500M (too small for venture scale)
❌ High regulatory burden (healthcare, finance, etc. without expertise)
❌ Requires behavior change (very hard)
❌ Network effects already locked in by incumbent

**Competition Red Flags:**
❌ Google/Amazon/Microsoft already dominating
❌ 5+ well-funded startups in space
❌ Category leader with 60%+ market share
❌ Price-based competition (race to bottom)

**Customer Red Flags:**
❌ Can't reach customers cost-effectively
❌ Sales cycle >12 months
❌ Low willingness to pay (<$100/year B2B, <$10 consumer)
❌ High churn industry (>5% monthly)

**Founder Red Flags:**
❌ No domain expertise and can't build quickly
❌ No network in industry
❌ Not passionate about problem space
❌ Skills mismatch (need deep tech but have sales skills only)

## Beachhead Market Selection

### Geoffrey Moore's Beachhead Strategy

**Concept:** Dominate a small, specific market before expanding

**Why It Works:**
- Easier to be #1 in small market than #10 in large market
- Builds credibility and case studies
- Creates word-of-mouth in tight-knit community
- Provides focus (don't dilute resources)
- Reference customers for adjacent markets

**Beachhead Criteria:**
1. **Specific and homogeneous** - Similar needs, easy to message
2. **Accessible** - Can reach and serve efficiently
3. **Compelling reason to buy** - Hair-on-fire problem
4. **Bridge to adjacent markets** - Expansion path clear

### Beachhead Examples

**Stripe:**
- Beachhead: Y Combinator startups
- Why: Developer-focused, needed simple payments, tight community
- Expansion: All online businesses

**Slack:**
- Beachhead: Tech startups and agencies
- Why: Early adopters, collaborative, will try new tools
- Expansion: All knowledge workers

**Salesforce:**
- Beachhead: Small-medium sales teams
- Why: Underserved by Oracle/Siebel (enterprise-focused)
- Expansion: Enterprise and all departments

**Facebook:**
- Beachhead: Harvard students
- Why: Trusted network, exclusivity created FOMO
- Expansion: All colleges → everyone

### Multi-Beachhead Consideration

Sometimes you need different beachheads based on:

**Geographic:**
- Start: San Francisco → Expand: Other US cities → International

**Vertical:**
- Start: Real estate → Expand: Insurance → All services

**Company Size:**
- Start: SMB (10-50 employees) → Expand: Mid-market → Enterprise

**Use Case:**
- Start: One specific job/workflow → Expand: Adjacent workflows → Platform

## Validation Techniques

### Desk Research Validation

**Google Trends:**
- Search volume trending up or down?
- Geographic interest patterns
- Related queries revealing intent

**Reddit/Forums:**
- r/Entrepreneur, r/startups, industry-specific subreddits
- What are people complaining about?
- What tools/solutions are recommended?
- How much passion in discussions?

**LinkedIn:**
- How many people have relevant job titles?
- Are companies hiring for this?
- What skills are in demand?

**Product Hunt, AngelList, Crunchbase:**
- Who's building in this space?
- How much funding have they raised?
- What's the competitive landscape?

### Customer Discovery Validation

**20-30 Customer Interviews:**

```
Interview structure:
1. "Tell me about your role" (context)
2. "Walk me through your workflow for [task]" (current state)
3. "What's frustrating about this?" (pain points)
4. "What have you tried?" (alternatives)
5. "How much does this cost you?" (economic value)
6. "What would an ideal solution look like?" (requirements)

Looking for:
- Consistent pain points (>50% mention it)
- Urgency (actively seeking solution)
- Budget (have money allocated)
- Authority (can make buying decision)
```

### Landing Page Test

**Build Simple Landing Page:**
1. Headline: Value proposition
2. Subheadline: Who it's for
3. 3 key benefits
4. Call-to-action (email signup or waitlist)
5. Social proof (if any)

**Drive Traffic:**
- Paid ads: Google, Facebook, LinkedIn ($500-1000 test)
- Post in relevant communities
- Email to network

**Success Metrics:**
- Conversion rate: >10% = strong interest
- Email signups: 50+ = validate further
- Cost per signup: <$10 = potentially viable
- Engagement: Do they ask questions? Share with others?

### Concierge MVP

**Manually Deliver the Service:**
- Don't build software yet
- Fulfill service manually
- Validate people will use and pay

```
Example: DoorDash
Before building app and marketplace:
- Founders personally took orders via phone/website
- Picked up food themselves
- Delivered food themselves
- Validated: People will pay for delivery

Learned:
- Pricing model
- Order frequency
- Restaurant partnerships needed
- Delivery logistics

Then built technology to scale
```

## Common Niche Selection Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Market Too Small
```
Problem: Falling in love with idea, ignoring market size
Impact: Can't reach venture scale, limited exit potential
Solution: Be honest about TAM, use bottom-up sizing
```

### Mistake #2: Market Too Broad
```
Problem: "Our market is everyone who uses computers"
Impact: Can't focus, competitors beat you in segments
Solution: Pick specific beachhead, expand later
```

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Competition
```
Problem: "We have no competitors" (wrong) or dismissing them
Impact: Underestimate difficulty, fail to differentiate
Solution: Understand why competitors exist, find your edge
```

### Mistake #4: Following Trends Blindly
```
Problem: Jumping on AI/crypto/web3 without deep thought
Impact: Crowded space, undifferentiated product
Solution: Find unique angle or skip hyped areas
```

### Mistake #5: No Personal Connection
```
Problem: Picking market based only on opportunity size
Impact: Lack of insight, lose passion during hard times
Solution: Choose markets where you have advantage or passion
```

## Advanced Niche Strategies

### Category Creation

**Create New Category vs. Compete in Existing:**

When to create new category:
- Existing category is saturated
- Your solution is fundamentally different
- Current categorization doesn't fit

How to create category:
- Name it clearly (not a made-up word)
- Define the problem it solves
- Educate market through content
- Get analysts (Gartner, Forrester) to recognize

Examples:
- Salesforce: Created "SaaS" category
- MongoDB: Created "NoSQL database" category
- Snowflake: Created "Data Cloud" category

### Platform Play

**Start Narrow, Build Platform:**

```
Evolution:
Year 1-2: Single use case (beachhead)
Year 3-4: Adjacent use cases
Year 5+: Platform (ecosystem)

Example: Amazon
1. Bookstore
2. All retail
3. Marketplace
4. AWS, Alexa, devices

Example: Shopify
1. Online store builder
2. Payments, shipping, marketing
3. App ecosystem
4. Logistics network
```

### Unbundling vs. Bundling

**Unbundling:**
- Take one feature from bloated product
- Make it best-in-class
- Example: Calendly (unbundled from Outlook)

**Bundling:**
- Combine multiple point solutions
- Integrated experience wins
- Example: HubSpot (marketing + sales + service)
