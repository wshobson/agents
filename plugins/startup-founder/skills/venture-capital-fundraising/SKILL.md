- Expanded or renewed contracts

- What alternatives did you consider?
- How would you rate the product and team?
- What could be improved?
- Would you recommend to others?

## Term Sheet Negotiation

### Key Terms to Understand

**Valuation:**
- Pre-money valuation: Company value before investment
- Post-money valuation: Pre-money + investment amount
- Fully-diluted basis: Includes all options and convertibles

**Option Pool:**
- Pre-money pool: Dilutes existing shareholders before new money
- Post-money pool: Dilutes everyone proportionally after
- Typical: 10-20% pool pre- or post-money

**Board Composition:**
- Typical Series A: 2 founders, 2 investors, 1 independent
- Board control matters for major decisions
- Observer rights for non-board investors

**Liquidation Preference:**
- 1x non-participating: Get money back first, then share pro-rata
- 1x participating: Get money back AND share pro-rata (avoid)
- Multiple liquidation prefs (2x, 3x): Red flag

**Anti-Dilution Protection:**
- Broad-based weighted average: Market standard (fair)
- Narrow-based or ratchet: Avoid (punitive to founders)
- Protects investors if next round is down round

**Vesting:**
- Founders: 4-year vest with 1-year cliff often required
- Acceleration: Single-trigger (on acquisition) or double-trigger (acquisition + termination)
- Standard for employees: 4-year vest, 1-year cliff

**Pro-Rata Rights:**
- Investors can maintain ownership % in future rounds
- Standard and reasonable

**Voting Rights:**
- Super-majority votes for major decisions
- Protective provisions (can't raise down round without approval)

**Drag-Along:**
- If majority of shareholders approve sale, others must too
- Protects against holdouts blocking exit

**No-Shop Clause:**
- Can't solicit other investors for 30-45 days
- Only accept once you're confident in deal

### Negotiation Strategy

**Key Principles:**

1. **Multiple term sheets create leverage**
   - Aim for 2-5 competing offers
   - Creates price competition and better terms
   - Shows market validation

2. **Don't over-optimize on valuation**
   - Higher valuation = higher bar for next round
   - Partner quality matters more than $
   - 20% valuation difference rarely matters long-term

3. **Focus on alignment and value-add**
   - Does investor understand your market?
   - Do they have relevant portfolio and expertise?
   - What's their reputation among founders?
   - Can they help with hiring, customers, strategy?

4. **Know your walk-away point**
   - Minimum acceptable valuation
   - Deal-breaker terms (e.g., participating preferred)
   - Alternative options (bootstrap, alternative investors)

5. **Use your lawyer**
   - Hire experienced startup attorney
   - They've seen hundreds of term sheets
   - Worth the cost for proper advice

**Common Mistakes:**

❌ Accepting first term sheet without competition
❌ Optimizing only on valuation
❌ Not checking references on investors
❌ Agreeing to participating preferred
❌ Giving up too much board control
❌ Not reading the fine print
❌ Rushing due diligence
