# Implementation Planning

Estimate development timelines and create implementation roadmaps.

## When to Use

- Planning strategy development
- Estimating resource requirements
- Creating project timelines
- Identifying critical path dependencies

## Timeline Estimation

### By Complexity

**LOW Complexity (1-2 weeks):**
- Daily/monthly rebalancing
- Standard data (Yahoo, IB)
- Simple calculations
- Example: Monthly S&P 500 momentum

**MEDIUM Complexity (4-8 weeks):**
- Daily rebalancing with moderate logic
- Some alternative data
- Basic ML or optimization
- Example: Daily mean reversion Russell 3000

**HIGH Complexity (8-16 weeks):**
- Intraday execution
- Extensive alternative data (13F)
- Advanced ML (embeddings, deep learning)
- Example: Asset Embeddings with Word2Vec

## Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Data Pipeline (20-30% of time)**
- Data acquisition setup
- Quality validation
- Point-in-time alignment
- Storage and retrieval

**Phase 2: Strategy Implementation (30-40%)**
- Core logic coding
- Signal generation
- Portfolio construction
- Rebalancing logic

**Phase 3: Backtesting (20-25%)**
- Historical simulation
- Transaction cost modeling
- Performance metrics
- Parameter validation

**Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (15-25%)**
- Out-of-sample validation
- Paper trading
- Live deployment (small scale)
- Monitoring setup

## Key Takeaways

- **Data pipeline takes 25% of time:** Don't underestimate
- **Testing is not optional:** Budget 20-25% for validation
- **Complex strategies take 3+ months:** Be realistic
- **Dependencies matter:** Identify blockers early
