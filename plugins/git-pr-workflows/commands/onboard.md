2. **Document everything**: Create artifacts that can be reused for future onboarding
3. **Measure success**: Track metrics and gather feedback continuously
4. **Iterate rapidly**: Adjust the plan based on what's working
5. **Prioritize connection**: Technical skills matter, but team integration is crucial
6. **Maintain momentum**: Keep the new hire engaged and progressing daily

Remember: Great onboarding reduces time-to-productivity from months to weeks while building lasting engagement and retention.
