# ADR-0001: Use PostgreSQL as Primary Database

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to select a primary database for our new e-commerce platform. The system
will handle:

- ~10,000 concurrent users
- Complex product catalog with hierarchical categories
- Transaction processing for orders and payments
- Full-text search for products
- Geospatial queries for store locator

The team has experience with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. We need ACID
compliance for financial transactions.

## Decision Drivers

- **Must have ACID compliance** for payment processing
- **Must support complex queries** for reporting
- **Should support full-text search** to reduce infrastructure complexity
- **Should have good JSON support** for flexible product attributes
- **Team familiarity** reduces onboarding time

## Considered Options

### Option 1: PostgreSQL

- **Pros**: ACID compliant, excellent JSON support (JSONB), built-in full-text
  search, PostGIS for geospatial, team has experience
- **Cons**: Slightly more complex replication setup than MySQL

### Option 2: MySQL

- **Pros**: Very familiar to team, simple replication, large community
- **Cons**: JSON querying/indexing differs from PostgreSQL JSONB; validate the
  required operators and indexes. Built-in FULLTEXT and spatial support exist,
  but their functions and limitations must be checked against this workload.
  See the [MySQL index reference](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/create-index.html).

### Option 3: MongoDB

- **Pros**: Flexible schema, native JSON, horizontal scaling
- **Cons**: No ACID for multi-document transactions (at decision time),
  team has limited experience, requires schema design discipline

## Decision

We will use **PostgreSQL 15** as our primary database.

## Rationale

PostgreSQL provides the best balance of:

1. **ACID compliance** essential for e-commerce transactions
2. **Built-in capabilities** (full-text search, JSONB) reduce infrastructure complexity
3. **Added extensions**: PostGIS supplies geospatial capabilities after server
   installation and [database enablement](https://postgis.net/documentation/getting_started/).
4. **Team familiarity** with SQL databases reduces learning curve
5. **Mature ecosystem** with excellent tooling and community support

The slight complexity in replication is outweighed by the reduction in
additional services (no separate Elasticsearch needed).

## Consequences

### Positive

- Single database handles transactions, search, and geospatial queries
- Reduced operational complexity (fewer services to manage)
- Strong consistency guarantees for financial data
- Team can leverage existing SQL expertise

### Negative

- Need to learn PostgreSQL-specific features (JSONB, full-text search syntax)
- Vertical scaling limits may require read replicas sooner
- Some team members need PostgreSQL-specific training

### Risks

- Full-text search may not scale as well as dedicated search engines
- Mitigation: Design for potential Elasticsearch addition if needed

## Implementation Notes

- Use JSONB for flexible product attributes
- Implement connection pooling with PgBouncer
- Set up streaming replication for read replicas
- Use pg_trgm extension for fuzzy search

## Related Decisions

- ADR-0002: Caching Strategy (Redis) - complements database choice
- ADR-0005: Search Architecture - may supersede if Elasticsearch needed

# ADR-0012: Adopt TypeScript for Frontend Development

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Deciders**: @alice, @bob, @charlie

## Context

Our React codebase has grown to 50+ components with increasing bug reports
related to prop type mismatches and undefined errors. PropTypes provide
runtime-only checking.

## Decision

Adopt TypeScript for all new frontend code. Migrate existing code incrementally.

## Consequences

**Good**: Catch type errors at compile time, better IDE support, self-documenting
code.

**Bad**: Learning curve for team, initial slowdown, build complexity increase.

**Mitigations**: TypeScript training sessions, allow gradual adoption with
`allowJs: true`.
```

# ADR-0015: API Gateway Selection

In the context of **building a microservices architecture**,
facing **the need for centralized API management, authentication, and rate limiting**,
we decided for **Kong Gateway**
and against **AWS API Gateway and custom Nginx solution**,
to achieve **vendor independence, plugin extensibility, and team familiarity with Lua**,
accepting that **we need to manage Kong infrastructure ourselves**.
```
