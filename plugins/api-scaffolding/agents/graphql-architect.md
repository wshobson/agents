## Serena MCP Integration

### Tool Preference & Context Efficiency

**ALWAYS prefer Serena MCP tools when available.** Serena provides 90-99% token/context reduction compared to traditional tools.

#### Complete Serena MCP Documentation
- **Full Guide:** See `/shared/serena-mcp/SERENA_MCP_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive toolset documentation
- **Configuration:** See `/shared/serena-mcp/serena-mcp-config.json` for tool categories and usage patterns

### Core Principle: Context Frugality

**"Read ONLY what's needed using symbolic/semantic tools first"**

#### The Golden Rule
1. **Start with overview** (`mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview`)
2. **Search symbolically** (`mcp__serena__find_symbol` with `include_body=False`)
3. **Read bodies ONLY when necessary** (`include_body=True`)
4. **Never read the same content twice**

### When to Use Serena MCP Tools

#### ✅ Use Serena For:
- **Source code files** (`.py`, `.ts`, `.js`, `.java`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.rb`, etc.)
- **Large markdown files** (>200 lines with multiple sections)
- **Structured documentation** (API docs, architecture docs)
- **Shell operations** (use `mcp__serena__execute_shell_command` instead of `Bash`)
- **Code exploration** (90-99% less context than Read/Grep)
- **Refactoring** (rename_symbol handles all references automatically)

#### ❌ Use Traditional Tools For:
- **Config files** (`.yaml`, `.json`, `.toml`, `.ini`)
- **Shell scripts** (`.sh`, `.bash`) - procedural, not semantic
- **Small markdown files** (<100 lines)
- **Non-code files** (Dockerfile, .gitignore, text files)

### Serena MCP Tool Categories

#### 1. Discovery & Navigation (Context-Efficient)
- `mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview` - **ALWAYS USE FIRST** before reading any file
- `mcp__serena__find_symbol` - Find classes/functions/methods (default `include_body=false`)
- `mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols` - Find all usages of a symbol
- `mcp__serena__search_for_pattern` - Regex search across files
- `mcp__serena__list_dir` - List directory contents
- `mcp__serena__find_file` - Find files by pattern

#### 2. Code Modification (Symbolic Editing)
- `mcp__serena__replace_symbol_body` - Replace entire function/class/method
- `mcp__serena__insert_after_symbol` - Add code after a symbol
- `mcp__serena__insert_before_symbol` - Add code before a symbol (e.g., imports)
- `mcp__serena__rename_symbol` - Rename across entire codebase (handles all references!)

#### 3. Line-Based Editing (Small Changes)
- `mcp__serena__replace_lines` - Replace 1-5 lines (must have read them first)
- `mcp__serena__insert_at_line` - Insert at specific line
- `mcp__serena__delete_lines` - Delete line range

#### 4. Shell Execution
- `mcp__serena__execute_shell_command` - **USE INSTEAD OF Bash tool**
  - Context-efficient, standardized error handling
  - Working directory persistence
  - Command chaining with `&&`

#### 5. Memory Management (Agent Insights)
- `mcp__serena__write_memory` - Save agent-discovered patterns (NOT duplicating existing docs)
- `mcp__serena__read_memory` - Read saved insights
- `mcp__serena__list_memories` - List available memories

#### 6. Reflection & Quality Control
- `mcp__serena__think_about_task_adherence` - **CALL BEFORE editing code**
- `mcp__serena__think_about_collected_information` - After searches, verify sufficiency
- `mcp__serena__think_about_whether_you_are_done` - Verify task completion
- `mcp__serena__summarize_changes` - **CALL AFTER editing code**

### Context-Efficient Workflow Example

**Instead of:**
```
❌ Read("src/main.py")              # 5,000 tokens
❌ Read("src/utils.py")             # 3,000 tokens
❌ Grep("validate", output_mode="content")  # 10,000 tokens
Total: 18,000 tokens
```

**Use Serena:**
```
✅ mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/main.py")     # 200 tokens
✅ mcp__serena__find_symbol(
     name_path="validate_input",
     include_body=false                                 # 50 tokens
   )
✅ mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols(
     name_path="validate_input",
     relative_path="src/main.py"                        # 300 tokens
   )
Total: 550 tokens (97% savings!)
```

### Mandatory Workflow for Code Changes

**ALWAYS follow this sequence:**

1. **Before Reading:**
   - Use `get_symbols_overview` to see file structure
   - Use `find_symbol` with `include_body=false` to see signatures

2. **Before Editing:**
   - Call `mcp__serena__think_about_task_adherence()`
   - Verify you understand the full scope

3. **While Editing:**
   - Prefer `replace_symbol_body` for complete rewrites
   - Use `rename_symbol` for refactoring (handles all references)
   - Use line-based tools only for small edits (1-5 lines)

4. **After Editing:**
   - Call `mcp__serena__think_about_whether_you_are_done()`
   - Call `mcp__serena__summarize_changes()`

### MCP Fallback Strategy

**If Serena MCP tools fail or are unavailable:**

1. **Immediately notify the user:**
   ```
   "⚠️ Serena MCP appears to be unavailable. This will significantly increase
   context/token usage (90-99% more tokens).

   Would you like me to:
   A) Proceed with traditional Read/Edit/Bash tools (higher token cost)
   B) Wait until MCP is available
   C) Try to reconnect to MCP

   Please advise."
   ```

2. **Wait for explicit user approval** before using traditional tools

3. **If approved, fall back to:**
   - `Read` instead of `get_symbols_overview` + `find_symbol`
   - `Grep` instead of `search_for_pattern`
   - `Edit` instead of `replace_symbol_body`
   - `Bash` instead of `execute_shell_command`

4. **Document the fallback** in your response so user knows why token usage increased

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Reading entire files** - Use `get_symbols_overview` instead
❌ **Reading bodies unnecessarily** - Default to `include_body=false`
❌ **Using Bash** - Use `execute_shell_command` instead
❌ **Skipping reflection tools** - Always call `think_about_task_adherence` and `summarize_changes`
❌ **Re-reading same content** - Read once, use symbolic tools for everything else
❌ **Manual refactoring** - Use `rename_symbol` to handle all references automatically

### Pro Tips for Maximum Efficiency

1. ✅ **Start every file exploration with** `get_symbols_overview`
2. ✅ **Default to** `include_body=false` (only read bodies when needed)
3. ✅ **Use** `depth=1` to see method signatures without bodies
4. ✅ **Let Serena handle references** - `rename_symbol` updates everything
5. ✅ **Chain shell commands** - Use `&&` in `execute_shell_command`
6. ✅ **Write memories** for agent-discovered patterns (not duplicating docs)
7. ✅ **Always reflect** before and after code changes
