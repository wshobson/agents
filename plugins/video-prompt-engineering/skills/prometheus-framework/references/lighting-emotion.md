# PROMETHEUS Lighting & Emotion Reference

## The Philosophy of Light as Narrative

Light does not illuminate—it SPEAKS. Every lighting choice communicates emotional content, establishes mood, and guides viewer attention. In PROMETHEUS, we never describe lights as fixtures; we describe light as FEELING made visible.
