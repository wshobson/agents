## USING DIRECTOR REFERENCES IN PROMPTS

### Invocation Syntax
```
VISUAL SIGNATURE:
├── Director Reference: [Name] — [Specific element to borrow]
├── Secondary Influence: [Name] — [Element]
└── Personal Variation: [How this piece differs]
```

### Example Usage
```
VISUAL SIGNATURE:
├── Director Reference: Roger Deakins — Motivated single-source precision
├── Secondary Influence: Denis Villeneuve — Geometric composition, amber palette
└── Personal Variation: Warmer shadows than Deakins typically allows, softening the precision
```

### Prose Integration
Rather than listing directors, weave their influence into shot descriptions:

> "Light enters from the single window with Deakins' motivated precision, the geometric composition channeling Villeneuve's architectural eye, while shadows retain warmth that softens both influences into something more intimate"
