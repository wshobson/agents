# PROMETHEUS Material Poetry Reference

## The Philosophy of Material Description

AI generators understand APPEARANCE, not PHYSICS. When describing materials, we must paint what the material LOOKS LIKE when light interacts with it, not its technical specifications. This reference translates material science into visual poetry.
