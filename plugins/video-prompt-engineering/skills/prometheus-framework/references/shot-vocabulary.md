### By Movement

| Pan | Horizontal rotation on axis | Following, scanning, revealing | "Vision sweeps across the horizontal plane, attention distributed across space like reading" |
| Tilt | Vertical rotation on axis | Vertical discovery, power dynamics | "Gaze ascends or descends the vertical, revealing what lies above or below initial address" |
| Push-In | Movement toward subject | Increasing intimacy, focus | "The lens breathes closer, drawn by emotional gravity toward connection with its subject" |
| Pull-Out | Movement away from subject | Release, revelation, distancing | "Vision retreats like a held breath released, context expanding with each frame of withdrawal" |
| Dolly | Parallel movement with subject | Accompaniment, observation | "Movement maintains constant relationship, witness traveling alongside without intrusion" |
| Tracking | Following movement, any direction | Pursuit, engagement | "The frame commits to its subject, movement answering movement in visual dialogue" |
| Crane/Jib | Vertical + horizontal movement | Transcendence, scope change | "Perspective liberated from terrestrial constraint, rising or falling with mechanical grace" |
| Steadicam | Smooth handheld floating | Dreamlike flow, immersion | "Movement flows with consciousness itself, freed from the jarring truth of walking" |
| Handheld | Deliberate instability | Immediacy, documentary feel | "The frame breathes with human imperfection, present and alive and imperfect" |
| Orbital | Arc around subject | Sculptural reveal, examination | "Vision traces circular path, discovering new facets with each degree of revolution" |
| Zoom | Optical focal length change | Emotional shift, unnatural draw | "Space compresses or expands through optical manipulation, a visual effect declaring its artifice" |

## Shot Combination Patterns

### The Reveal Sequence
```
SHOT 1: ECU Detail (mysterious, textural)
SHOT 2: Pull-back to CU (context begins)
SHOT 3: Continue to MS (full revelation)
SHOT 4: LS Environmental (complete understanding)
```

### The Intimacy Approach
```
SHOT 1: LS Establishing (distance, context)
SHOT 2: MS Subject approach (recognition)
SHOT 3: MCU Engagement (connection forming)
SHOT 4: CU Emotional peak (intimacy achieved)
SHOT 5: ECU Climax detail (obsessive focus)
```

### The Dialogue Dance
```
SHOT 1: Two-shot MS (relationship established)
SHOT 2: OTS to Speaker A (perspective claim)
SHOT 3: Reverse OTS to Speaker B (response)
SHOT 4: CU reactions (emotional truth)
SHOT 5: Return to two-shot (resolution)
```

### The Power Shift
```
SHOT 1: High angle subject (vulnerability)
SHOT 2: Eye level transition (neutrality)
SHOT 3: Low angle subject (power gained)
SHOT 4: Extreme low (dominance complete)
```

### The Environmental Portrait
```
SHOT 1: ELS Environment (world established)
SHOT 2: LS Subject in space (relationship)
SHOT 3: MS Subject engagement (personality)
SHOT 4: CU Environmental detail (texture)
SHOT 5: Return LS (synthesis)
```

## Prose Templates by Shot Type

### ECU Template
> "[Subject feature] fills the frame with [textural quality], every [microscopic detail] visible with [intimate/invasive/obsessive] clarity. Light [traces/catches/reveals] the [surface quality], transforming [material] into [poetic landscape metaphor]. The [feature] speaks of [history/purpose/character] through [physical evidence], each [detail element] a [metaphor for significance]."

### CU Template
> "[Subject] occupies the frame with [emotional quality], features [lighting description] by [light source]. [Facial element 1] reveals [emotional state through physical description], while [facial element 2] [behavioral description suggesting feeling]. The [background description] dissolves into [bokeh quality] behind, all attention demanded by [what draws focus]."

### MS Template
> "[Subject] holds the frame at [relational distance], body language [communicating emotional state] through [physical posture description]. [Hand/arm description] suggests [psychological state], while [clothing/surface] catches [light quality]. The [environment element] visible at frame edges provides [contextual information] without [competing for attention]."

### LS Template
> "[Subject] occupies [their spatial relationship] within [environment description], [body language] revealing [emotional/purposeful state] across the distance. [Environmental elements] frame the composition with [quality], while [atmospheric conditions] create [mood description]. The [spatial relationship] between subject and surroundings speaks of [thematic element]."

### Movement Template (Push-In)
> "The lens breathes [direction] with [speed quality] inevitability, drawn by [emotional gravity metaphor] toward [destination]. [Initial frame content] begins to [transition verb] as [new content] claims increasing [frame percentage]. The movement [continues/accelerates/decelerates] with [emotional quality], arriving at [final composition] with the [satisfying quality] of [metaphor]."

## Duration Guidelines

### By Emotional Impact

| Emotional Need | Duration | Shot Type Preference | Pacing Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Quick recognition | 0.5-1.0s | CU, MCU | Rapid cut, immediate read |
| Information absorption | 1.0-2.0s | MS, MLS | Standard pace, comfortable |
| Emotional connection | 2.0-3.0s | CU, ECU | Lingering, breathing |
| Contemplation | 3.0-5.0s | Any with movement | Slow, patient |
| Transcendence | 5.0-8.0s | LS, ELS with movement | Epic, meditative |
| Tension building | Variable | Static CU | Duration creates unease |

### By Information Density

| Content Complexity | Minimum Duration | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Single focal point | 0.75s | Quick read possible |
| Two competing elements | 1.5s | Eye needs travel time |
| Complex environment | 2.5s | Scanning required |
| Movement + composition | 3.0s | Action must complete |
| Emotional transformation | 4.0s+ | Face needs time to change |

## Common Mistakes and Corrections

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| "Wide shot of subject" | Vague, no emotional intent | "LS establishing subject within environment, relationship between figure and space speaking of [theme]" |
| "Close-up of face" | Clinical, no poetry | "CU captures features illuminated by [light quality], [emotional evidence] visible in [specific facial elements]" |
| "Camera moves left" | Mechanical description | "Vision drifts leftward with [emotional quality], attention following [what draws it]" |
| "Zoom to close-up" | Technical without purpose | "Space compresses with [emotional urgency], distance collapsing as intimacy demands [revelation]" |
| "Static shot, 3 seconds" | No sensory content | "The frame holds with [contemplative/tense/patient] stillness for three breaths of [what quality]" |
