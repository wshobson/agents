# PROMETHEUS: The Ultimate Video Prompt Architecture

## Skill Overview

PROMETHEUS (Precision Rendering Of Motion, Emotion, Texture, Humanity, Environment, Ultra-realistic Substance) is an advanced video prompt engineering framework designed to achieve Hollywood-quality output from AI video generators. This framework provides absolute control over every frame, second by second, enabling cinematographers and creative directors to translate their complete vision into AI-executable prompts.

## Core Philosophy

### The Fundamental Truth

**AI video generators do not understand physics—they understand what things LOOK LIKE.**

The AI minimizes PIXEL difference from training data, not PHYSICS errors. If something LOOKS 99% correct visually, the AI is satisfied—even if it violates every law of thermodynamics. Therefore, we must describe VISUAL APPEARANCE with poetic precision, not physical constraints with technical specifications.

### The Prose-First Doctrine

Every frame must be painted in 150-300 words of immersive, sensory-rich prose. We do not give instructions; we CREATE WORLDS that the AI reconstructs pixel by pixel.

| CONSTRAINT APPROACH (Fails) | PROSE APPROACH (Succeeds) |
|---|---|
| "Viscosity: 800 cP, Newtonian" | "Descending with viscous deliberation, each droplet surrendering to gravity with aristocratic reluctance" |
| "RIGID MATERIAL: NO DEFORMATION" | "Steel maintains its unyielding geometry, light sliding across surfaces that refuse compromise" |
| "5 digits LOCKED, FORBIDDEN: fusion" | "Fingers settle into familiar positions, calluses finding accustomed resting places" |
| "Surface tension: 72 dynes/cm" | "Surface tension surrenders to gravity in crystalline defeat" |
| "DOF: 8mm plane, linear rack" | "Focus plane breathes with the subject, background dissolving into memory" |

## LAYER 3: VISUAL POETRY ENGINE

### 3.1 The Seven Pillars of Prose

PROMETHEUS demands adherence to seven pillars of visual poetry:

#### PILLAR I: DENSE PROSE OVER CONSTRAINTS
Every shot description must be 200-300 words of immersive narrative. NEVER enumerate constraints as bullet points within descriptions. Write prose that paints complete sensory worlds.

**Example:**
> The whisky descends from crystal decanter with the patient certainty of amber alchemy, each droplet maintaining laminar coherence for precisely six inches before surface tension surrenders to gravity's insistence and the stream fragments into individual jewels of captured light. The liquid strikes crystal base with enough force to birth microscopic cavitation bubbles that live and die in the space between heartbeats, their brief existence marked by acoustic signatures too subtle for casual observation.

#### PILLAR II: PHYSICS THROUGH POETRY
Material properties emerge through description, not specification.

| Instead Of | Write |
|---|---|
| "Viscosity: 800 cP" | "Moving with the deliberate patience of substances that understand their own preciousness" |
| "Reynolds number: laminar" | "Each molecule maintaining its position in the procession with ceremonial discipline" |
| "Surface tension: 72 mN/m" | "The liquid's skin holds with stubborn integrity until the moment of gentle surrender" |

#### PILLAR III: MATERIALS THROUGH BEHAVIOR
Describe how materials ACT, not their technical specifications.

| Instead Of | Write |
|---|---|
| "Albedo: 0.08, IOR: 1.52" | "Crystal catches light and refuses to release it without first fragmenting it into rainbow confetti" |
| "SSS depth: 2.3mm" | "Skin glows with translucent warmth, blood vessels painting rose undertones beneath surface" |
| "Metalness: 0.95" | "Steel mirrors the world with cold precision, each scratch a biography of use" |

#### PILLAR IV: EMOTIONS THROUGH PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION
Never use clinical emotion labels. Describe the physical evidence of feeling.

| Instead Of | Write |
|---|---|
| "Expression: happy" | "Corners of mouth surrender to gravity's opposite, crow's feet deepening with genuine amusement" |
| "Mood: contemplative" | "Eyes focus on distances that exist only in memory, breathing slowing to match thought's pace" |
| "Feeling: anticipation" | "Fingers tighten almost imperceptibly, chest expanding with held breath" |

#### PILLAR V: CAMERA AS CONSCIOUSNESS
Camera movement serves narrative purpose, described as intentional storytelling.

| Instead Of | Write |
|---|---|
| "Push-in 0.5cm/sec" | "The lens breathes closer, drawn by magnetic intimacy toward the moment of connection" |
| "Pan left 30°" | "Vision drifts leftward with the reluctance of attention being pulled elsewhere" |
| "Crane up 2m" | "Perspective ascends like a departing spirit, reluctantly releasing terrestrial attachment" |

#### PILLAR VI: ATMOSPHERIC IMMERSION
Every frame breathes with environment, described through particulate poetry.

| Instead Of | Write |
|---|---|
| "Dust density: 50/m³" | "Motes of forgotten time drift through light columns like visible memories" |
| "Steam: 200 particles" | "Thermal wisps rise with Brownian inevitability, each one a tiny universe of warmth" |
| "Fog: visibility 10m" | "Air thickens with moisture, distances dissolving into suggestion rather than certainty" |

#### PILLAR VII: LIGHT AS EMOTION
Illuminate scenes with feeling, not just fixtures.

| Instead Of | Write |
|---|---|
| "Key: 3200K, 800 lux" | "Tungsten warmth spills across surfaces with the intimacy of candlelit confession" |
| "Fill: 1:4 ratio" | "Shadows soften just enough to preserve detail without betraying the mood's privacy" |
| "Backlight: rim edge" | "Light traces edges like a lover's finger outlining familiar territory" |

### 3.2 Material Poetry Dictionary

Use these translations to convert BRDF specifications into prose:

#### Liquids (Viscosity Translation)

| Liquid | Viscosity (cP) | Visual Behavior | Prose Translation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Water | 1 | Fast splash, turbulent, crystalline | "Exploding into crystalline shards, each droplet a universe of captured light" |
| Wine | 2 | Low surface tension, staining, legs | "Cascading in ruby ribbons, leaving violet traces like memory on glass" |
| Coffee | 1.5 | Opaque, staining, steam rising | "Dark as secrets kept, steam rising in silent confession toward heaven" |
| Milk | 3 | Opaque SSS, foam capable | "White clouds blooming through darkness, subsurface light giving it inner warmth" |
| Olive Oil | 80 | Slow pour, coating, golden | "Golden viscosity sliding with deliberate patience, coating everything it touches with light" |
| Heavy Cream | 200 | Coating, layering, ribbons | "Thick ribbons descending with dairy weight, each fold holding its shape with protein memory" |
| Honey | 10,000 | Stretching, coiling rope | "Golden ropes stretching toward earth, resisting gravity with stubborn sweetness" |
| Chocolate | 25,000 | Coating, glossy, yield stress | "Molten darkness flowing with ritual slowness, coating surfaces with edible shadow" |
| Whisky | 800 | Laminar flow, slow legs, amber | "Amber alchemy descending with aristocratic patience, legs forming on glass like slow tears" |

#### Solids (BRDF Translation)

| Material | Light Behavior | Prose Translation |
|---|---|---|
| Glass/Crystal | High transmission, caustics | "Light passes through like time through memory, fragmenting into rainbow archaeology" |
| Polished Metal | Mirror reflection, tight highlights | "Surfaces catch light and hold it hostage, releasing only perfect reflections" |
| Brushed Metal | Anisotropic reflection | "Linear highlights follow the grain of industrial finishing like rivers following valleys" |

## LAYER 5: PHOTOREALISTIC DIRECTIVES

### 5.1 The Photorealistic Directive Block

This critical section translates technical requirements into prose while maintaining scientific accuracy. It should be 300-400 words of continuous prose covering:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHOTOREALISTIC GENERATION DIRECTIVES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[300-400 words of CONTINUOUS PROSE covering:]

1. MATERIAL AUTHENTICITY
   - Primary materials and their light interaction behavior
   - Surface properties through behavioral description
   - Subsurface scattering where applicable (skin, liquids, translucent materials)

2. OPTICAL CHARACTERISTICS
   - Lens breathing behavior during focus transitions
   - Chromatic aberration limits (described as visual quality)
   - Bokeh characteristics matching chosen lens profile
   - Vignette falloff as frame feeling

3. SURFACE AUTHENTICITY
   - Micro-wear patterns appropriate to object history
   - Fingerprints, scratches, dust where realistic
   - Environmental deposits (condensation, residue, patina)

4. TEMPORAL CONSISTENCY
   - Frame-to-frame material coherence requirements
   - Reflection consistency across movement
   - Liquid dynamics governed by appropriate physics
   - Zero morphing artifacts, texture swimming, or impossible transformations

5. AI LIMITATION WORKAROUNDS
   - Soft descriptions for elements prone to AI failure
   - Vague reflection references (preventing hallucinated environments)
   - Simple hand poses with expected visual outcomes
   - Graceful steam/foam descriptions accepting imperfection
```

---

## AI LIMITATION WORKAROUNDS

### Known Failure Modes and Solutions

#### 1. THE HONEY EFFECT (Fluid Dynamics)
**Problem:** AI renders ALL liquids too viscous. Water behaves like motor oil. Streams don't break into droplets naturally.

**Solution:** Describe the VISUAL APPEARANCE of proper flow behavior.
```
INSTEAD OF: "Viscosity: 1.2 cP, turbulent flow, Reynolds number >4000"
WRITE: "Water cascades with crystalline abandon, each splash birthing dozens of
airborne jewels that catch light before gravity reclaims them"
```

#### 2. REFLECTION HALLUCINATION
**Problem:** Chrome/metal surfaces reflect environments that don't exist (windows, lights, people not in scene).

**Solution:** Keep reflections vague and behavioral.
```
INSTEAD OF: "Reflection must match surrounding geometry, HDRI-consistent"
WRITE: "Brushed steel catches ambient warmth, surfaces worn to soft focus by years
of careful polishing, reflections more suggestion than documentation"
```

#### 3. HAND ANATOMY COLLAPSE
**Problem:** No inverse kinematics solver. Impossible joint angles, webbing between fingers, digit count fluctuation.

**Solution:** Simple poses, describe expected visual outcome.
```
INSTEAD OF: "Hand Digits: 5 (LOCKED), Phalangeal Structure: Integrity enforced"
WRITE: "Fingers settle into familiar positions around the grip, calluses finding
accustomed resting places, each digit positioned with the unconscious precision
of ten thousand repetitions"
```

#### 4. STEAM/FOAM MORPHING
**Problem:** Steam loops repetitively, foam textures shift randomly throughout duration.

**Solution:** Soft descriptions that accept organic variation.
```
INSTEAD OF: "Steam: Must rise chaotically, NO looping, maintain thermal updraft physics"
WRITE: "Steam rises in ephemeral wisps, each vapor tendril catching light before
dissolving into memory, the thermal dance never quite repeating yet always familiar"
```

#### 5. TEXT/LOGO HALLUCINATION
**Problem:** Specific text requests produce gibberish ("VONESTRAMOOR SWISS OXWE").

**Solution:** Describe QUALITY feeling, not literal text.
```
INSTEAD OF: "Text reads: OMEGA Seamaster Professional 300m"
WRITE: "The dial displays the quiet confidence of Swiss precision engineering,
typography speaking of heritage through form rather than explicit reading"
```

#### 6. SCREEN/UI HALLUCINATION
**Problem:** Specific UI elements become unreadable glitches.

**Solution:** Soft-focus abstraction for digital elements.
```
INSTEAD OF: "iPhone screen shows Instagram app with 1,247 notifications"
WRITE: "Glowing interface elements pulse with soft notification shapes, digital
warmth emanating from the screen's geometry without demanding specific reading"
```

#### 7. MACRO DEPTH FLICKER
**Problem:** Thin objects drift in/out of focus unexpectedly.

**Solution:** Describe as intentional breathing.
```
INSTEAD OF: "DOF: 8mm plane, background blur radius: consistent"
WRITE: "Focus plane breathes with natural rhythm, background dissolving into
impressionist suggestion as attention narrows to intimate scale"
```

The AI will give you what you show it through language. Show it Hollywood.
