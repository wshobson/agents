# PROMETHEUS Template: Food & Beverage Commercial

## Use Case
Restaurant commercials, beverage advertising, culinary process documentation, artisanal food craft

## Duration Recommendation
15-30 seconds

## Recommended Settings
- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 or 2.39:1 for cinematic food
- **Camera:** RED V-RAPTOR or ARRI Alexa Mini LF
- **Lens:** Zeiss Supreme Prime 50mm or macro for detail
- **Lighting Mood:** Warm intimate (2400-3200K)
- **Director Reference:** Ridley Scott (atmospherics) or Denis Villeneuve (precision)

## Critical AI Workarounds for Food
- **Liquids:** Always describe visual behavior, NEVER viscosity specs
- **Steam:** Accept "ephemeral" and "dissolving" to avoid looping artifacts
- **Pouring:** Describe the visual stream, not physics of flow
- **Foam:** Soft descriptions accepting organic variation
- **Hands:** Simple poses, describe expected outcome not anatomy

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[DESCRIBE THE KEY LIQUID/FINISHING MOMENT - 200-300 words]

POUR SHOT PROSE TEMPLATE:
[Liquid] emerges from [source] like [poetic comparison], [color description]
[movement description] with the [speed quality] of substances that understand
their own [preciousness/purpose/nature]. The stream [thickness description]
as [gravity/pressure] builds, [color progression description] suggesting
[quality indicator]. Contact with [receiving surface] creates [behavior] -
[detailed description of what happens when liquids meet].

EXAMPLE - Coffee Pour:
"Espresso emerges from the portafilter spouts like liquid theology made visible,
twin streams of mahogany gold descending with viscous deliberation. The extraction
displays textbook perfection—initial droplets hesitating at the spout edges before
surface tension surrenders to gravity, the streams thickening as pressure builds,
the color progressing from blonde through caramel to the deep chestnut that
indicates optimal extraction time."

EXAMPLE - Sauce/Syrup Pour:
"Chocolate descends with ritual slowness, molten darkness coating surfaces with
edible shadow, each fold maintaining shape through yield stress before surrendering
to the inevitable. The gloss catches light like patent leather, reflections
dancing across the liquid surface before absorption claims the illumination."

CAMERA CONSCIOUSNESS:
├── ENTRY (X.XXs): Pre-pour anticipation or pour in progress
├── JOURNEY (X.XXs): Following liquid trajectory (often slow-motion)

[DESCRIBE THE FINISHED FOOD IN FULL GLORY - 200-300 words]

The completed [dish] occupies the frame with [quality], every element of culinary
craft visible and legible. [Primary component] [position and appearance], while
[secondary elements] provide [visual function - color contrast, textural variety].

Steam rises with [quality] from [heat source], each thermal wisp an invitation
to proximity, an aromatic messenger translating flavor into visible vapor.

itself speaks of [appropriate quality - rustic charm/refined elegance].

[Describe surface textures - crispy, glazed, caramelized, fresh...]

PHOTOREALISTIC GENERATION DIRECTIVES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Material authenticity demands obsessive attention to food surfaces and their
light interaction. [Primary food] must display appropriate [surface quality]
with [color accuracy description] that speaks to [freshness/quality indicator].
Liquid elements—[specific liquids]—behave with visual accuracy: [describe
expected pour behavior, surface tension, color gradation] without the
excessive viscosity that plagues AI generation. Steam rises with ephemeral
naturalism, each vapor wisp unique and dissolving before repetition becomes
visible, accepting organic variation rather than demanding physical perfection.

Human hands, if present, maintain expected visual outcome through simple poses
and behavioral description rather than anatomical constraint. The [utensils/
vessels] display appropriate material properties: [ceramic glossiness/metal
reflection/wood grain] contributing to but not competing with food as hero.

Temporal consistency ensures the dish remains THE dish throughout—colors stable,
textures consistent, garnishes holding position, steam behavior natural without
looping artifacts. No morphing, no impossible material transformations, surfaces
maintaining their character from first frame to last.
