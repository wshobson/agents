[DESCRIBE THE LANDSCAPE REVEAL - 250-350 words for environmental shots]

The [environment] reveals itself with [time of day] majesty, [primary geological
feature] dominating the horizon like [metaphor appropriate to scale]. Light
descends through [atmospheric condition] with the [quality] of [poetic comparison],
painting [surfaces] in gradients of [color progression]. The scale defies
comfortable human comprehension—[specific scale reference using recognizable
comparisons].

MOUNTAIN PROSE PATTERNS:
"Peaks pierce the [color] sky like ancient sentinels guarding secrets of stone
and snow, their faces catching [time of day] light in gradients that shift from
[color] to [color] across geological striations. Snow caps hold the sun's
attention longest, glowing with [quality] while lower slopes surrender to shadow's
advance. Distance creates blue atmospheric layers, each range behind the next
painted with increasingly desaturated palette until the furthest peaks exist more
as suggestion than certainty."

WATER PROSE PATTERNS (Lakes, Rivers, Ocean):
"Water holds the sky's [color] in perfect suspension, surface [behavior - still
as glass / rippling with wind / dancing with current] creating [reflection quality].
Where shore meets water, [describe transition zone]. Light penetrates [depth
estimate], revealing [underwater visibility elements]. The [body of water] stretches
toward [horizon/mountains/forest] with the patience of geological time."

FOREST PROSE PATTERNS:
"The canopy creates its own architecture, [tree species] reaching toward light
with the patient determination of centuries. Undergrowth fills the spaces between
giants with [vegetation description]. Light filters through leaves in [dappled/
scattered/diffuse] patterns, each gap in foliage creating a spotlight for dust
motes and insects. The forest breathes with [wind behavior], branches swaying
in rhythms dictated by air currents invisible to cameras but visible in their
effect on vegetation."

Duration: [X.XX]s ([X.XX]s - [X.XX]s)
Shot Type: CU/ECU, [Angle], [Movement through detail]
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[DESCRIBE INTIMATE NATURAL DETAIL - 200-300 words]

At this scale, [environment] reveals complexity invisible from distance.
[Specific detail element - dewdrop, bark texture, water droplet, sand grain]
catches [light quality] with [behavior description], transforming
microscopic world into landscape of its own.

WATER DETAIL PROSE:
"Each droplet clings to [surface] with the certainty of surface tension, lens-like
clarity magnifying the [background element] beyond. Light refracts through water's
curve, creating miniature caustic patterns on the [receiving surface] below.
Movement—[source of movement]—sends subtle tremors through the droplet's surface,
distorting reflection without breaking liquid integrity."

VEGETATION DETAIL PROSE:
"The [leaf/petal/bark] reveals architecture only visible at intimate distance.
[Cellular/vein/texture] patterns create visual rhythms across the surface, each
[element] a highway for [function metaphor]. Light penetrates [material property],
creating [SSS description] that gives [living quality] to the organic structure.
[Moisture/texture/color variation] evidence of [life process]."

ROCK/MINERAL DETAIL PROSE:
"Stone reveals its geological biography at this proximity, [millions] of years
compressed into [readable surface detail]. Crystalline structures catch light
with [behavior], while [mineral type] creates veins of [color] through the
matrix. The surface [texture description - polished by water, weathered by wind,
sharp from fracture]."

CAMERA CONSCIOUSNESS:
├── ENTRY (X.XXs): Finding detail within environment
├── JOURNEY (X.XXs): Macro exploration or focus breathing
└── ARRIVAL (X.XXs): Perfect moment of textural revelation

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Duration: [X.XX]s ([X.XX]s - [X.XX]s)
Shot Type: [Various], [Angle], [Following movement]
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[DESCRIBE WATER IN MOTION - 200-300 words]

WATERFALL PROSE:
"Water surrenders to gravity with [speed quality], the stream [fracturing/
maintaining coherence] as it descends toward [impact point]. Mid-fall, the mass
transforms—solid stream becoming [visual description - mist/spray/ribbons],
individual droplets catching light like [comparison]. Impact creates [base
description - pool behavior, mist generation, sound implied through visual].
The waterfall's voice exists only in the imagination, but the spray's behavior
speaks of thunderous presence."

STREAM/RIVER PROSE:
"Current moves with the [speed quality] of [comparison], surface [reflecting/
refracting] [light quality] in constant transformation. Where water meets
[obstacle], [behavior description - parting, swirling, cresting]. Submerged
stones create visible geometry in the flow, each interruption generating its
own downstream signature. [Foam/bubbles/debris] travels the surface like
[comparison], marking current's invisible path."

OCEAN PROSE:
"Waves approach with [rhythm description], each crest catching [light] before
surrendering to gravity's call. The break translates energy into visible chaos—
[foam behavior], [spray behavior], [sound implied]. Retreating water leaves
[beach detail - foam patterns, wet sand reflection, debris lines]. The ocean's
breathing continues beyond frame, eternal and indifferent."

CAMERA CONSCIOUSNESS:
├── ENTRY (X.XXs): Water movement entering or established
├── JOURNEY (X.XXs): Following flow (often slow-motion)
└── ARRIVAL (X.XXs): Moment of peak visual interest

Duration: [X.XX]s ([X.XX]s - [X.XX]s)
Shot Type: [Varies], [Often backlit or god rays], [Often static or slow]
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[DESCRIBE TRANSCENDENT LIGHT MOMENT - 200-300 words]

Light transforms from illumination to substance, [describe visibility of rays,
beams, atmospheric effects]. The [time of day] sun finds passage through
[gap in clouds/trees/mountains], creating [visual effect]. Every particle
of [atmospheric element] becomes visible in the beam, each mote a tiny
universe [behavior description].

GOLDEN HOUR PROSE:
"The sun paints its farewell across [landscape] in gradients of amber and copper,
every surface catching fire with borrowed warmth. Shadows stretch toward
tomorrow, purple and blue against the orange flood. The light at this angle
forgives imperfection, softens edges, transforms ordinary terrain into the
mythic. These minutes exist in their own temporal category—too precious to waste,
too beautiful to fully capture."

GOD RAYS PROSE:
"Light achieves visibility through the atmospheric medium, beams descending like
ladders between heaven and earth. Each ray carries its own geometry, edges
defined by the particles that scatter its intention. Where beam meets ground,
a spotlight of significance—as if nature itself directs attention to this
particular spot at this particular moment."

BLUE HOUR PROSE:
"Between day and night, the world holds its breath in blue suspension. Neither
warm nor cool, the light belongs to no familiar category—it is transition made
visible, potential before decision. [Landscape features] wait in this liminal
moment, their shadows uncertain, their colors muted to a palette of possibility."

CAMERA CONSCIOUSNESS:
├── ENTRY (X.XXs): Light beginning its revelation
├── JOURNEY (X.XXs): Often static, allowing light to change

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHOTOREALISTIC GENERATION DIRECTIVES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Environmental authenticity demands attention to [region-specific] geological
and botanical accuracy. [Primary landscape features] must display appropriate
[weathering/growth/water] patterns consistent with [climate zone] conditions.
Vegetation follows [seasonal] behavior with [deciduous/evergreen/tropical]
characteristics appropriate to [location type].

Water surfaces maintain [expected behavior for type - still/flowing/crashing]
with accurate reflection properties: [mirror when still, fractured when moving],
and appropriate transparency revealing [depth-appropriate] subsurface detail.
Atmospheric perspective increases with distance, each layer of landscape
[color shift toward blue/desaturated] according to [kilometer estimate].

Sky elements—[clouds/sun/moon]—maintain position consistency throughout duration,
movement following natural timescale (imperceptible in short durations unless
timelapse indicated). Light temperature progression follows natural arc if
time passage is implied. Temporal consistency ensures no impossible changes
in shadow direction, vegetation position, or geological feature.

Wildlife, if present, behaves with naturalistic movement patterns appropriate
to species, avoiding repetitive loop artifacts in flight/movement sequences.
