# Conductor Setup

Initialize or resume Conductor project setup. This command creates foundational project documentation through interactive Q&A.

## Pre-flight Checks

1. Check if `conductor/` directory already exists in the project root:
   - If `conductor/product.md` exists: Ask user whether to resume setup or reinitialize
   - If `conductor/setup_state.json` exists with incomplete status: Offer to resume from last step

2. Detect project type by checking for existing indicators:
   - **Greenfield (new project)**: No .git, no package.json, no requirements.txt, no go.mod, no src/ directory
   - **Brownfield (existing project)**: Any of the above exist

3. Load or create `conductor/setup_state.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "in_progress",
     "project_type": "greenfield|brownfield",
     "current_section": "product|guidelines|tech_stack|workflow|styleguides",
     "current_question": 1,
     "completed_sections": [],
     "answers": {},
     "files_created": [],
     "started_at": "ISO_TIMESTAMP",
     "last_updated": "ISO_TIMESTAMP"
   }
   ```

## Interactive Q&A Protocol

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Ask ONE question per turn
- Wait for user response before proceeding
- Offer 2-3 suggested answers plus "Type your own" option
- Maximum 5 questions per section
- Update `setup_state.json` after each successful step
- Validate file writes succeeded before continuing

```

**Q2: Commit Strategy**

```
What commit strategy should be followed?

## Artifact Generation

After completing Q&A, generate the following files:

### 1. conductor/index.md

```markdown
# Conductor - [Project Name]

Navigation hub for project context.

## Quick Links

- [Product Definition](./product.md)
- [Product Guidelines](./product-guidelines.md)
- [Tech Stack](./tech-stack.md)
- [Workflow](./workflow.md)
- [Tracks](./tracks.md)

## Active Tracks

<!-- Auto-populated by /conductor:new-track -->

## Getting Started

Run `/conductor:new-track` to create your first feature track.
```

### 2. conductor/product.md

Template populated with Q&A answers for:

- Project name and description
- Problem statement
- Target users
- Key goals

### 3. conductor/product-guidelines.md

Template populated with:

- Voice and tone
- Design principles
- Any additional standards

### 4. conductor/tech-stack.md

Template populated with:

- Languages (with versions if detected)
- Frameworks (frontend, backend)
- Database
- Infrastructure
- Key dependencies (for brownfield, from package files)

### 5. conductor/workflow.md

Template populated with:

- TDD policy and strictness level
- Commit strategy and conventions
- Code review requirements
- Verification checkpoint rules
- Task lifecycle definition

### 6. conductor/tracks.md

```markdown
# Tracks Registry

| Status | Track ID | Title | Created | Updated |
| ------ | -------- | ----- | ------- | ------- |

<!-- Tracks registered by /conductor:new-track -->
```

### 7. conductor/code_styleguides/

Generate selected style guides from `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/templates/code_styleguides/`

## State Management

After each successful file creation:

1. Update `setup_state.json`:
   - Add filename to `files_created` array
   - Update `last_updated` timestamp
   - If section complete, add to `completed_sections`
2. Verify file exists with `Read` tool

## Completion

When all files are created:

1. Set `setup_state.json` status to "complete"
2. Display summary:

   ```
   Conductor setup complete!

   Created artifacts:
   - conductor/index.md
   - conductor/product.md
   - conductor/product-guidelines.md
   - conductor/tech-stack.md
   - conductor/workflow.md
   - conductor/tracks.md
   - conductor/code_styleguides/[languages]

   Next steps:
   1. Review generated files and customize as needed
   2. Run /conductor:new-track to create your first track
   ```

## Resume Handling

If `--resume` argument or resuming from state:

1. Load `setup_state.json`
2. Skip completed sections
3. Resume from `current_section` and `current_question`
4. Verify previously created files still exist
5. If files missing, offer to regenerate

## Error Handling

- If file write fails: Halt and report error, do not update state
- If user cancels: Save current state for future resume
- If state file corrupted: Offer to start fresh or attempt recovery
