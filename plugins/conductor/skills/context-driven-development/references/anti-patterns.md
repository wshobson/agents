# Common Anti-Patterns

Avoid these context management mistakes:

### Stale Context

Problem: Context documents become outdated and misleading.
Solution: Update context as part of each track's completion process.

### Context Sprawl

Problem: Information scattered across multiple locations.
Solution: Use the defined artifact structure; resist creating new document types.

### Implicit Context

Problem: Relying on knowledge not captured in artifacts.
Solution: If you reference something repeatedly, add it to the appropriate artifact.

### Context Hoarding

Problem: One person maintains context without team input.
Solution: Review context artifacts in pull requests; make updates collaborative.

### Over-Specification

Problem: Context becomes so detailed it's impossible to maintain.
Solution: Keep artifacts focused on decisions that affect AI behavior and team alignment.
