# Context Maintenance Principles

### Keep Artifacts Synchronized

Ensure changes in one artifact reflect in related documents:

- New feature in product.md → Update tech-stack.md if new dependencies needed
- Completed track → Update product.md to reflect new capabilities
- Workflow change → Update all affected track plans

### Update tech-stack.md When Adding Dependencies

Before adding any new dependency:

1. Check if existing dependencies solve the need
2. Document the rationale for new dependencies
3. Add version constraints
4. Note any configuration requirements

### Update product.md When Features Complete

After completing a feature track:

1. Move feature from "planned" to "implemented" in product.md
2. Update any affected success metrics
3. Document any scope changes from original plan

### Verify Context Before Implementation

Before starting any track:

1. Read all context artifacts
2. Flag any outdated information
3. Propose updates before proceeding
4. Confirm context accuracy with stakeholders
