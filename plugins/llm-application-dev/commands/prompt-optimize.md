# Prompt Optimization

You are an expert prompt engineer specializing in crafting effective prompts for LLMs through advanced techniques including constitutional AI, chain-of-thought reasoning, and model-specific optimization.

## Context

Transform basic instructions into production-ready prompts. Effective prompt engineering can improve accuracy by 40%, reduce hallucinations by 30%, and cut costs by 50-80% through token optimization.

## Requirements

$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

### 1. Analyze Current Prompt

Evaluate the prompt across key dimensions:

**Assessment Framework**
- Clarity score (1-10) and ambiguity points
- Structure: logical flow and section boundaries
- Model alignment: capability utilization and token efficiency
- Performance: success rate, failure modes, edge case handling

**Decomposition**
- Core objective and constraints
- Output format requirements
- Explicit vs implicit expectations
- Context dependencies and variable elements

### 2. Apply Chain-of-Thought Enhancement

**Standard CoT Pattern**
```python
# Before: Simple instruction
prompt = "Analyze this customer feedback and determine sentiment"

# After: CoT enhanced
prompt = """Analyze this customer feedback step by step:

1. Identify key phrases indicating emotion
2. Categorize each phrase (positive/negative/neutral)
3. Consider context and intensity
4. Weigh overall balance
5. Determine dominant sentiment and confidence

Customer feedback: {feedback}

Step 1 - Key emotional phrases:
[Analysis...]"""
```

**Zero-Shot CoT**
```python
enhanced = original + "\n\nLet's approach this step-by-step, breaking down the problem into smaller components and reasoning through each carefully."
```

**Tree-of-Thoughts**
```python
tot_prompt = """
Explore multiple solution paths:

Problem: {problem}

Approach A: [Path 1]
Approach B: [Path 2]
Approach C: [Path 3]

Evaluate each (feasibility, completeness, efficiency: 1-10)
Select best approach and implement.
"""
```

### 3. Implement Few-Shot Learning

**Strategic Example Selection**
```python
few_shot = """
Example 1 (Simple case):
Input: {simple_input}
Output: {simple_output}

Example 2 (Edge case):
Input: {complex_input}
Output: {complex_output}

Example 3 (Error case - what NOT to do):
Wrong: {wrong_approach}
Correct: {correct_output}

Now apply to: {actual_input}
"""
```

### 4. Apply Constitutional AI Patterns

**Self-Critique Loop**
```python
constitutional = """
{initial_instruction}

Review your response against these principles:

1. ACCURACY: Verify claims, flag uncertainties
2. SAFETY: Check for harm, bias, ethical issues
3. QUALITY: Clarity, consistency, completeness

Initial Response: [Generate]
Self-Review: [Evaluate]
Final Response: [Refined]

    def __init__(self, base_prompt):
        self.version = "1.0.0"
        self.base_prompt = base_prompt
        self.variants = {}
        self.performance_history = []

    def rollout_strategy(self):

            "canary": 5,
            "staged": [10, 25, 50, 100],
            "rollback_threshold": 0.8,
            "monitoring_period": "24h"
        }
```

**Error Handling**
```python
robust_prompt = """
{main_instruction}

## Error Handling

1. INSUFFICIENT INFO: "Need more about {aspect}. Please provide {details}."
2. CONTRADICTIONS: "Conflicting requirements {A} vs {B}. Clarify priority."
3. LIMITATIONS: "Requires {capability} beyond scope. Alternative: {approach}"
4. SAFETY CONCERNS: "Cannot complete due to {concern}. Safe alternative: {option}"

### Usage Guidelines
1. **Implementation**: Use optimized prompt exactly
2. **Parameters**: Apply recommended settings
3. **Testing**: Run test cases before production
4. **Monitoring**: Track metrics for improvement
5. **Iteration**: Update based on performance data

Remember: The best prompt consistently produces desired outputs with minimal post-processing while maintaining safety and efficiency. Regular evaluation is essential for optimal results.
