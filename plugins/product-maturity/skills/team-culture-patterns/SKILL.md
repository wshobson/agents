## Cultural Philosophies

### Amazon: Leadership Principles

**14 Leadership Principles** that guide every decision:

1. **Customer Obsession**: Start with customer, work backwards
2. **Ownership**: Act on behalf of entire company, long-term thinking
3. **Invent and Simplify**: Seek new ideas, simplify complex
4. **Are Right, A Lot**: Good judgment, strong instincts, seek diverse perspectives
5. **Learn and Be Curious**: Never done learning, always improving
6. **Hire and Develop the Best**: Raise performance bar with every hire
7. **Insist on the Highest Standards**: Relentlessly high standards
8. **Think Big**: Bold direction inspires results
9. **Bias for Action**: Speed matters, calculated risk-taking
10. **Frugality**: Do more with less, resourcefulness
11. **Earn Trust**: Listen, speak candidly, treat others respectfully
12. **Dive Deep**: Stay connected to details, audit frequently
13. **Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit**: Challenge decisions, commit once decided
14. **Deliver Results**: Focus on key inputs, deliver with right quality

**Application:**
- Every interview question maps to principles
- Performance reviews evaluated against principles
- Decision-making guided by principles
- Cultural consistency across organization

**Example in Practice:**
```markdown
# Decision: Should we delay feature to improve quality?

## Leadership Principles Analysis

**Customer Obsession** ✅
- Customers prefer reliable features over rushed ones

**Ownership** ✅
- Long-term reputation more important than short-term deadline

**Insist on the Highest Standards** ✅
- Our quality bar requires more testing

**Deliver Results** ⚠️
- Missing deadline impacts business goals

**Bias for Action** ⚠️
- Delay means lost opportunity

## Decision: Delay by 1 week, add testing, launch with quality
Rationale: Customer trust is long-term asset, one week delay is acceptable
```

### Netflix: Freedom and Responsibility

**Core Philosophy:** Responsible people thrive on freedom; become more innovative and effective.

**Cultural Pillars:**

**1. Context, Not Control**

- Teams have freedom to execute
- Trust over micromanagement

**2. Highly Aligned, Loosely Coupled**
- Clear goals and strategy (alignment)
- Teams decide how to achieve (loose coupling)
- Collaboration without coordination overhead

**3. No Rules Rules**
- Minimize policies and procedures
- Hire adults who don't need babysitting
- Context enables good decisions

**4. Keeper Test**
- "If person resigned, would you fight to keep them?"
- If no, help them find better fit elsewhere
- High performance over tenure

**Implementation:**
```markdown
## Netflix Culture Practices

```

### Google: Psychological Safety

**Project Aristotle Research:** Studied 180+ teams to find what makes teams effective.

**Key Finding:** Psychological safety is most important factor.

**Psychological Safety:** Team members feel safe to take risks, be vulnerable, speak up without fear of embarrassment or punishment.

**Five Key Dynamics:**
1. **Psychological Safety**: Can take risks without feeling insecure
2. **Dependability**: Count on each other for quality work
3. **Structure & Clarity**: Clear roles, plans, goals
4. **Meaning**: Work is personally important
5. **Impact**: Work matters and creates change

**Building Psychological Safety:**

**Leadership Behaviors:**
- Admit mistakes openly
- Ask for feedback genuinely
- Welcome questions and challenges
- Respond positively to bad news
- Share credit, take blame

**Team Practices:**
- **Turn-taking**: Everyone speaks roughly equally
- **Social sensitivity**: Reading others' emotions
- **No interruptions**: Everyone heard
- **Disagree without judgment**: Ideas challenged, not people
- **Blameless post-mortems**: Learn from failures

**Conversation Framework:**
```markdown
## Blameless Post-Mortem Template

### What Happened?
[Timeline of events, factual]

### What Was the Impact?
[Users affected, duration, business impact]

### What Went Well?

### Asynchronous First (Remote-Friendly)

**Principles:**
1. **Document by default**: Write it down
2. **Async-first communication**: Don't assume synchronous
3. **Transparent context**: Share widely
4. **Minimize meetings**: Respect time zones
5. **Over-communicate**: Clarity over brevity

**Tools and Practices:**
```markdown
## Async Communication Guidelines

### Documentation
- Decision records (ADRs)
- Meeting notes (public by default)
- Design docs
- Status updates

### Communication Channels
- **Chat**: Urgent, quick questions
- **Email**: Important, needs response
- **Docs**: Collaboration, feedback
- **Meetings**: Decision-making only

### Response Time Expectations
- **Urgent (P0)**: < 1 hour
- **Important (P1)**: < 4 hours
- **Normal (P2)**: < 24 hours
- **Low (P3)**: < 3 days

### Meeting Hygiene
- Agenda required
- Pre-reads shared 24h before
- Record for those who can't attend
- Notes and decisions documented
```

### Standups (Synchronous)

**Format:**
```markdown
## Daily Standup (15 min max)

### Round Robin (2 min each):
**Yesterday:** Shipped mobile checkout UI
**Today:** Integrating payment API
**Blockers:** Need design approval on error states

### Parking Lot:
- Detailed discussions after standup
- Only relevant people stay
```

**Anti-patterns:**
- Status reports to manager
- Detailed problem-solving
- Over 15 minutes
- Not discussing blockers

## Hiring and Onboarding

### Bar Raiser Program (Amazon)

**Concept:** Designated interviewers who ensure every hire raises the bar.

**Bar Raiser Role:**

2. On-site (4-5 hours)
   - Coding (2 rounds)
   - System design (1 round)
   - Behavioral (2 rounds)
   - Bar raiser (1 round, overlaps with others)

3. Debrief
   - Each interviewer shares feedback
   - Bar raiser facilitates
   - Unanimous decision required
   - "Would this person raise our bar?"
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent quality
- Long-term thinking
- Cultural consistency
- Reduced bias

### Google: Structured Interviewing

**Principles:**
- Same questions for all candidates
- Rubrics for evaluation
