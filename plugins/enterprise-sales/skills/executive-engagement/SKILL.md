### Executive Touchpoint Cadence

**Tier 1 Strategic Accounts**:

4. **Build Relationships**: Invest in trust before you need it
5. **Speak Their Language**: Tailor messaging to each executive's priorities
6. **Bring Insights**: Teach them something new about their business
7. **Be a Partner**: Act as advisor, not vendor
8. **Follow Through**: Do what you promise, every time
