- Developing comprehensive account plans for strategic customers
- Conducting white space and opportunity analysis
- Mapping organizational structures and relationships
- Planning multi-year account growth strategies
- Identifying expansion opportunities
- Managing executive stakeholder relationships

## Account Planning Framework

### 1. Account Profile

**Business Understanding**:
- Industry, market position, competitive landscape
- Business model (B2B, B2C, marketplace, SaaS, etc.)
- Revenue, profitability, growth trajectory
- Strategic initiatives and priorities (from annual reports, earnings calls)
- Technology stack and digital maturity

**Organizational Structure**:
- Executive leadership team (CEO, CFO, CIO, CTO, COO, CISO)
- Business unit structure and reporting lines
- IT/Technology organization structure
- Procurement and legal teams
- Decision-making processes and approval hierarchies

**Current Engagement**:
- Products/services currently deployed
- Annual contract value (ACV) and total contract value (TCV)
- Contract renewal dates
- Usage metrics and adoption rates
- Relationship health (NPS, satisfaction scores)
- Support history and escalations

### 2. Stakeholder Mapping

**RACI Matrix for Key Stakeholders**:
- **R**esponsible: Who does the work?
- **A**ccountable: Who makes decisions?
- **C**onsulted: Who provides input?
- **I**nformed: Who needs to know?

**Relationship Strength Assessment**:
- **Level 5 (Strategic Partner)**: C-level trust, multi-year partnership, co-innovation
- **Level 4 (Trusted Advisor)**: VP-level relationships, proactive engagement
- **Level 3 (Preferred Vendor)**: Strong working relationships, responsive engagement
- **Level 2 (Approved Vendor)**: Transactional relationship, reactive engagement
- **Level 1 (Unknown)**: No relationship or at risk

**Power Map**:
- High Power/High Support: **Champions** (leverage for expansion)
- High Power/Low Support: **Blockers** (address concerns or work around)
- Low Power/High Support: **Advocates** (use to influence others)
- Low Power/Low Support: **Neutral** (deprioritize)

### 3. White Space Analysis

**Product Penetration**: Which VK Cloud products are deployed vs. available?
- ✓ Deployed: VK Kubernetes, VK Data Platform (PostgreSQL)
- ○ Available: VK Object Storage, VK Private Cloud, VK Data Platform (ClickHouse, Kafka)

**Use Case Expansion**: What additional use cases can be served?
- Current: Development/test environments
- Potential: Production workloads, data analytics, disaster recovery, AI/ML

**Business Unit Expansion**: Which departments/divisions can adopt?
- Current: IT department pilot
- Potential: Marketing (analytics), Finance (reporting), Operations (automation)

**Geographic Expansion**: Which regions/countries can deploy?
- Current: Moscow headquarters
- Potential: Regional offices (St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, etc.)

**User Expansion**: How many potential users vs. current users?
- Current: 50 developers using VK Kubernetes
- Potential: 200+ developers, 30+ data engineers, 15+ ML engineers

### 4. Opportunity Identification

**Expansion Opportunities Template**:

| Opportunity | Product/Service | Business Unit | Value ($) | Probability | Timeline |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Data Lake | VK Object Storage + ClickHouse | Marketing Analytics | $150K ARR | 70% | Q2 2024 |
| Prod Migration | VK Kubernetes expansion | Engineering | $500K ARR | 60% | Q3 2024 |
| DR Solution | VK Private Cloud | IT Operations | $300K ARR | 40% | Q4 2024 |

**Prioritization Criteria**:
- **Value**: Revenue potential (ARR)
- **Probability**: Likelihood of closing (%)
- **Strategic**: Reference potential, competitive displacement, ecosystem expansion
- **Timeline**: When decision will be made

### 5. Growth Strategy

**Land-and-Expand Playbook**:

**Phase 1 - Land** (Months 1-6):
- Start with low-risk, high-value use case
- Pilot with single team or business unit
- Prove value with measurable ROI
- Build champion relationships

**Phase 2 - Expand** (Months 6-18):
- Replicate success in adjacent teams/use cases
- Cross-sell additional VK Cloud products
- Engage executive sponsors for enterprise-wide adoption
- Negotiate multi-year expansion agreements

**Phase 3 - Transform** (Months 18-36):
- Become strategic partner for digital transformation
- Co-innovate on new capabilities
- Achieve preferred vendor status
- Expand to 50%+ of addressable opportunity

**Growth Targets**:
- **Year 1**: $200K ARR (land with pilot)
- **Year 2**: $600K ARR (3x growth through expansion)
- **Year 3**: $1.2M ARR (2x growth through transformation)
- **NRR Target**: 150%+ (net revenue retention)

### 6. Executive Engagement Plan

**Quarterly Touchpoints**:

**Q1**:
- QBR with CIO/CTO (technology roadmap alignment)
- Executive roundtable invitation (industry peers discussion)
- ROI report delivery (value achieved to date)

**Q2**:
- CFO briefing (cost optimization and budget planning)
- Strategic account review with internal executives
- Expansion proposal for data analytics use case

**Q3**:
- CEO/CFO executive briefing center visit
- Multi-year strategic partnership proposal
- Co-marketing case study discussion

**Q4**:
- Annual strategic planning session
- Renewal negotiation (if applicable)
- Next-year growth plan alignment

### 7. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

**Risk Categories**:

**Relationship Risk**:
- Risk: Champion leaves company
- Mitigation: Multi-thread relationships (build 3-5 strong relationships)

**Competitive Risk**:
- Risk: AWS/Yandex Cloud attacks account
- Mitigation: Deep product adoption, executive sponsorship, value documentation

**Budget Risk**:
- Risk: Budget cuts impact expansion plans
- Mitigation: Demonstrate ROI, flexible payment terms, phased approach

**Technical Risk**:
- Risk: Integration challenges or performance issues
- Mitigation: Proactive technical support, architecture reviews, escalation path

**Political Risk**:
- Risk: Internal politics block initiatives
- Mitigation: Executive alignment, champion development, multi-stakeholder buy-in
