# Negotiation Frameworks

## When to Use This Skill

- Negotiating enterprise contracts and pricing
- Handling discount requests and concessions
- Structuring multi-year deals and payment terms
- Navigating procurement and legal reviews
- Resolving impasses and deadlocks
- Preparing for high-stakes negotiations

## Core Frameworks

### BATNA Analysis (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement)

**Your BATNA**: What will you do if this deal doesn't close?
- Walk away and pursue other opportunities
- Offer to smaller customer segments
- Accept lower pricing for strategic reasons

**Their BATNA**: What will they do if they don't buy from you?
- Choose competitor solution
- Build in-house
- Do nothing (status quo)

**Strategy**: The stronger your BATNA relative to theirs, the more negotiating power you have.

### ZOPA Analysis (Zone of Possible Agreement)

- **Your Reservation Price**: Minimum you'll accept ($80K)
- **Your Aspiration Price**: Ideal outcome ($120K)
- **Their Reservation Price**: Maximum they'll pay ($100K)
- **Their Aspiration Price**: Ideal for them ($70K)
- **ZOPA**: $80K-$100K (overlap where deal is possible)

**Strategy**: Anchor high ($120K), negotiate down to ZOPA middle ($90K)

### Harvard Negotiation Principles

1. **Separate People from Problem**: Maintain relationship while being firm on issue
2. **Focus on Interests, Not Positions**: Understand underlying needs
3. **Invent Options for Mutual Gain**: Expand value before dividing
4. **Use Objective Criteria**: Market standards, benchmarks, precedent

### FBI Negotiation Tactics (Chris Voss)

**Tactical Empathy**: "It seems like budget is a concern..."
**Mirroring**: Repeat last 3 words to encourage elaboration
**Labeling**: "It sounds like you're worried about implementation risk"
**Calibrated Questions**: "How am I supposed to offer 40% discount and maintain quality?"
**Accusation Audit**: "You probably think we're overpriced compared to competitors..."
**"No"-Oriented Questions**: "Is now a bad time to discuss pricing?"

## Negotiation Tactics

### Anchoring

**Set First Anchor High**:
- Present aspiration price first (10-20% above target)
- Justify with value, ROI, market positioning
- Use confidence and conviction

**Counter-Anchoring**:
- If they anchor low, reset with data
- "Based on market rates and value delivered, typical pricing is $X"
- Bring objective criteria (benchmarks, comparables)

### Concession Strategy

**Rules for Concessions**:
1. **Never give without getting**: "If we reduce price by 10%, would you commit to 3-year term?"
2. **Diminishing returns**: Each concession smaller (10%, 5%, 2%)
3. **Slow concessions**: Take time between concessions
4. **Justify concessions**: Explain why ("For 3-year commitment, we can offer...")
5. **Trade, don't cave**: Exchange concessions for value

**Non-Price Concessions** (trade these before price):
- Professional services credits
- Extended trial period
- Training and certification
- Priority support upgrades
- Flexible payment terms
- Product roadmap influence

### Handling "Your Price is Too High"

**Tactic 1 - Reframe to Value**:
- "What would make this investment worthwhile for you?"
- Focus on ROI and business outcomes
- Quantify cost of inaction

**Tactic 2 - Unbundle**:
- "Let's break down what you're getting: [list components]"
- Show value of each element
- Justify pricing with comparables

**Tactic 3 - TCO Analysis**:
- Compare total cost vs. alternatives (include hidden costs)
- "AWS may look cheaper upfront, but data egress costs $X, support is $Y..."

**Tactic 4 - Conditional Discount**:
- "If we offered X% discount, would you commit to Y-year term and Z additional products?"

### Deadline Leverage

**Create Urgency**:
- "This pricing expires end of quarter"
- "We have limited capacity for new customers in Q1"
- "Budget approved for this year, uncertain next year"

**Use Fiscal Calendar**:
- Q4 (especially December): Vendors need to close deals
- Q1: Customers have fresh budgets
- Q2-Q3: Less time pressure, more leverage

**Timing Tactics**:
- 80% of concessions happen in final 20% of negotiation time
- Wait for deadline pressure before making final concessions

### Handling Procurement

**Understand Their KPIs**:
- Cost savings vs. budget
- Vendor consolidation
- Contract compliance
- Risk mitigation

**Procurement Tactics**:
- Provide market benchmarking data
- Offer preferred vendor agreements (volume discounts across business units)
- Standardize terms (MSA + order forms for faster processing)
- Build relationship early (don't wait until contracting stage)

## Deal Structuring

### Pricing Models

**Volume-Based**: Tiered discounts at scale milestones
**Multi-Year**: 10% discount for 2-year, 15% for 3-year
**Prepayment**: 10-15% discount for annual prepay
**Ramp Deal**: Lower Year 1, higher Year 2-3
**Committed Spend**: Minimum annual commit for better rates

### Payment Terms

**Standard**: Net 30 days
**Extended**: Net 60-90 days (for strategic accounts)
**Annual Prepay**: 10-15% discount
**Quarterly**: No discount, higher admin overhead

### Contract Clauses to Negotiate

**Must Defend** (non-negotiable):
- Limitation of liability (12 months of fees)
- IP indemnification (protect your IP)
- No-refund policy (except breach)

**Can Concede** (customer-friendly):
- Extended payment terms (Net 60/90)
- Auto-renewal opt-out rights
- Audit rights (reasonable frequency)

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Give us 40% discount or we go with competitor"

**Response**:
1. Accusation Audit: "I imagine [Competitor] positioned themselves as cheaper?"
2. Differentiation: "Here's what you get with us that they don't offer: [value]"
3. TCO Analysis: "Let's look at total cost over 3 years, including [hidden costs]"
4. Conditional: "If we offered 20% discount for 3-year commit, would that work?"
5. Walk Away: "At 40% off, we can't deliver the value you need. That wouldn't be fair to you."

### Scenario 2: "We need to think about it"

**Response**:
1. Calibrated Question: "What concerns haven't we addressed?"
2. Narrow the Gap: "What would need to change for you to move forward?"
3. Risk Reversal: "What if we included a 60-day money-back guarantee?"
4. Time Constraint: "This pricing expires [date]. After that, new rates apply."

### Scenario 3: "Legal is slowing us down"

**Response**:
1. Engage Directly: "Can we schedule a call with Legal to address their concerns?"
2. Standard Terms: "We've negotiated with 500+ enterprises. Here's our standard paper."
3. Redlines: "Here are the clauses we can/cannot modify and why."
4. Attorney-to-Attorney: "Let's have our legal teams talk directly."

## Key Principles

1. **Anchor High**: First number sets reference point
2. **Trade, Don't Cave**: Never give without getting
3. **Silence**: After offer, stay silent—let them process
4. **Objective Criteria**: Use data to justify positions
5. **BATNA is Power**: Know your alternatives
6. **Emotions vs. Logic**: Acknowledge emotions, decide with logic
7. **Win-Win or Walk**: Bad deals destroy long-term value
8. **Information Asymmetry**: Ask questions, reveal strategically
9. **Time Kills Deals**: Create urgency through deadlines
10. **Commit & Consistency**: Get small commitments first
