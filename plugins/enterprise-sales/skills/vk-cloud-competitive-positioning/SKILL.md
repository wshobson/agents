- Migrating from on-premises VMware/OpenStack/Rostelecom Data Centers
- Handling "Why not AWS/Yandex?" objections
- Creating competitive battlecards for any cloud provider
- Positioning data sovereignty and compliance advantages
- Defending against competitive attacks in enterprise deals

## VK Cloud Core Value Proposition

**"Russian Cloud. Global Standards."**

1. **Data Sovereignty**: Full compliance with Russian data laws (152-FZ, 187-FZ)
2. **Cost Advantage**: 20-40% lower TCO than global hyperscalers
3. **No Sanctions Risk**: Immune to geopolitical service disruptions
4. **Local Support**: Russian-language, timezone-aligned, in-country escalation
