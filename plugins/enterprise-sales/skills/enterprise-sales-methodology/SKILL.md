# Enterprise Sales Methodology

## When to Use This Skill

- Qualifying complex enterprise opportunities
- Conducting effective discovery conversations
- Assessing deal health and win probability
- Structuring sales process and stage gates
- Coaching sales teams on methodology
- Analyzing stuck or at-risk deals

## Core Sales Methodologies

### MEDDPICC Framework

**Purpose**: Rigorous qualification for complex enterprise deals ($500K+)

**M - Metrics**: What economic impact will this solution deliver?
- Quantified business value (cost savings, revenue growth, efficiency gains)
- ROI, payback period, NPV calculations
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) that will improve

**E - Economic Buyer**: Who has budget authority and P&L responsibility?
- Typically VP or C-level with P&L ownership
- Has power to allocate budget and approve spending
- Measured on business outcomes, not technical features
- Must engage directly—no deal without economic buyer access

**D - Decision Criteria**: What technical and business requirements must be met?
- Formal evaluation criteria (technical, financial, operational)
- Weighted scoring model (must-haves vs. nice-to-haves)
- Influence decision criteria to favor your strengths
- Documented in RFP, evaluation matrix, or decision document

**D - Decision Process**: What is the formal approval process and timeline?
- Who is involved in the decision? (RACI matrix)
- What are the approval gates? (technical review, budget approval, legal review, executive approval)
- What is the timeline for each stage?
- Documented process vs. actual process (often differ!)

**P - Paper Process**: What legal, procurement, and contracting steps are required?
- Procurement involvement and requirements
- Legal review process and standard timelines
- Security/compliance reviews
- Signature authority and approval chain
- Typical duration: 2-8 weeks (plan accordingly)

**I - Identify Pain**: What critical business problems are driving urgency?
- Business pain severe enough to motivate change
- Cost of inaction (what happens if they do nothing?)
- Compelling event (contract renewal, regulation, competitive threat)
- Quantified impact of pain (dollars, time, risk)

**C - Champion**: Who will sell internally on our behalf?
- Has credibility and influence within organization
- Personally benefits from success (career, bonus, recognition)
- Provides insider intelligence (politics, competitors, decision process)
- Actively coaches you on how to win
- **Test**: Will they introduce you to economic buyer and other stakeholders?

**C - Competition**: What alternatives are being considered?
- Direct competitors (AWS, Azure, Yandex Cloud, etc.)
- Indirect competitors (DIY, other solutions)
- Status quo (do nothing)
- Their strengths, weaknesses, and strategies
- Your differentiation and why you'll win

**MEDDPICC Scoring**:
- Score each element: 0 (not addressed), 1 (partially addressed), 2 (fully addressed)
- **Green**: 14-16 points (high confidence)
- **Yellow**: 10-13 points (needs work)
- **Red**: 0-9 points (disqualify or significant gaps to address)

### SPIN Selling

**Purpose**: Consultative discovery to uncover implicit needs and build urgency

**S - Situation Questions**: Understand current state
- "Walk me through your current architecture/process"
- "What technologies are you using today?"
- "How many users/transactions/data volume?"
- **Caution**: Don't over-ask. Move to problem questions quickly.

**P - Problem Questions**: Uncover pain points and challenges
- "What challenges are you experiencing with current solution?"
- "What's not working as well as you'd like?"
- "What's preventing you from achieving [goal]?"
- **Goal**: Surface both explicit pain (known) and implicit pain (hidden)

**I - Implication Questions**: Amplify consequences of inaction
- "What impact does this have on [revenue/costs/efficiency]?"
- "How does this affect your customers/employees?"
- "What happens if this problem isn't solved in the next 6 months?"
- "What's the cost to the business?" (quantify!)
- **Purpose**: Build urgency by making small problems feel large

**N - Need-Payoff Questions**: Connect solution to business outcomes
- "How would solving this improve [business metric]?"
- "What would it mean for your team if [capability]?"
- "If we could reduce [problem] by 50%, what would that enable?"
- **Purpose**: Get customer to articulate value (more powerful than you telling them)

**SPIN in Practice**:
1. Start with Situation questions (5-10 minutes)
2. Move to Problem questions (identify pain)
3. Use Implication questions to amplify pain
4. Close with Need-Payoff questions (customer articulates value)
5. Present solution only after customer sees need

### Challenger Sale

**Purpose**: Reframe customer thinking and take control of the conversation

**Three Core Principles**:

**1. Teach for Differentiation**:
- Teach customers something new about their business
- Provide insights they don't have (market trends, competitive intelligence, best practices)
- Reframe their understanding of the problem
- **Example**: "Companies in your industry are solving this problem differently. Here's what they're doing..."

**2. Tailor for Resonance**:
- Customize messaging for each stakeholder
- CFO cares about ROI and cost. CTO cares about technology and innovation. CEO cares about strategy.
- Use their language, priorities, and metrics
- **Example**: CFO conversation focuses on NPV and payback period. CTO conversation focuses on architecture and scalability.

**3. Take Control**:
- Use constructive tension—challenge customer assumptions
- Push back on unrealistic expectations or flawed thinking
- Be willing to walk away from bad-fit deals
- **Example**: "Based on what you've shared, I'm not sure we're the right fit. Here's why..."

**Challenger Conversation Flow**:
1. **Warm-Up**: Build rapport, establish credibility
2. **Reframe**: "I'd like to share a different perspective..."
3. **Rational Drowning**: Present data/insights that challenge current thinking
4. **Emotional Impact**: "This is costing you $X million annually"
5. **New Way**: "Here's how leading companies are solving this"
6. **Your Solution**: Position your solution as the path to the new way

### Strategic Selling (Miller Heiman)

**Purpose**: Navigate complex B2B buying committees

**Four Buyer Types**:

**Economic Buyer**:
- Has budget authority and P&L responsibility
- Cares about: ROI, business outcomes, competitive advantage
- Approval: Final decision-maker
- **Strategy**: Quantify business value and strategic impact

**User Buyer**:
- Will use the product day-to-day
- Cares about: Usability, features, workflows, productivity
- Approval: Can veto if solution doesn't meet needs
- **Strategy**: Demonstrate ease of use and feature fit

**Technical Buyer**:
- Evaluates technical fit and feasibility
- Cares about: Architecture, integration, security, scalability
- Approval: Can veto if solution doesn't meet technical requirements
- **Strategy**: Prove technical credibility and capability

**Coach**:
- Internal guide who wants you to win
- Provides intelligence on politics, process, and competitors
- Helps navigate organization
- **Strategy**: Build trust, provide value, ask for coaching

**Blue Sheet Analysis**:
- Map each stakeholder: Role, Influence Level, Support Level (Advocate/Supportive/Neutral/Against)
- Identify gaps: Who haven't you engaged?
- Develop strategy for each: What do they need to see/hear to support you?

- Purchase order received
- Implementation kickoff scheduled

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

**Pitfall**: "We have a champion, but we can't get to the economic buyer"
**Solution**: Your champion isn't strong enough. Find a higher-level champion or accept this is a low-probability deal.

**Pitfall**: "The customer says budget is approved, but we can't confirm with economic buyer"
**Solution**: Budget is not actually approved. Push for direct economic buyer engagement.

**Pitfall**: "We've been in evaluation for 6 months with no decision"
**Solution**: No compelling event. Create urgency or disqualify the opportunity.

**Pitfall**: "We found out about competition at the last minute"
**Solution**: Poor discovery. Always assume competition and ask about it early.

**Pitfall**: "The customer went with a competitor despite positive POC"
**Solution**: Champion wasn't strong enough, or you didn't engage economic buyer effectively.

**Pitfall**: "Legal is holding up the deal"
**Solution**: Start legal/procurement conversations early (during evaluation, not at close).

## Key Principles

1. **Qualify Hard, Close Easy**: Rigorous early qualification prevents late-stage surprises
2. **No Champion, No Deal**: You cannot win without someone selling for you internally
3. **Economic Buyer Access**: If you can't reach the economic buyer, you're not in control
4. **Metrics Matter**: Quantify everything. Vague value propositions lose to hard numbers.
5. **Competition is Real**: Assume you're always competing. Know your enemy.
6. **Compelling Event**: No urgency = no deal this quarter. Identify or create urgency.
7. **Process Discipline**: Shortcuts in sales process lead to forecast misses and lost deals
8. **MEDDPICC Every Deal**: Score every opportunity. If it's red, fix it or disqualify.
