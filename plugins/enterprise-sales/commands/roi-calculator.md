# ROI Calculator

You will build a comprehensive ROI analysis for VK Cloud solutions with CFO-grade financial rigor.

## Process

### 1. Gather Baseline Data

**Current State Costs** (Annual):

**Infrastructure**:
- On-premises hardware (servers, storage, networking): $X
- Datacenter costs (power, cooling, space): $X
- Cloud costs (if using AWS/Azure/GCP): $X
- Hardware refresh cycle (every X years): $X/year amortized

**Personnel**:
- IT operations staff: X FTEs × $XXK = $X
- Database administrators: X FTEs × $XXK = $X
- DevOps engineers: X FTEs × $XXK = $X
- Time spent on maintenance/ops: X% of total time

**Software Licensing**:
- OS licenses: $X
- Database licenses (Oracle, MSSQL): $X
- Virtualization (VMware, etc.): $X
- Monitoring/management tools: $X

**Operational Costs**:
- Support contracts: $X
- Training: $X
- Downtime cost: X hours/year × $X/hour = $X
- Technical debt / inefficiency: $X (quantified)

**Current State Total**: $XXX,XXX/year

### 2. Future State Costs (VK Cloud)

**VK Cloud Services** (Annual):
- VK Kubernetes: $X
- VK Data Platform: $X
- VK Object Storage: $X
- VK Public/Private Cloud: $X
- Support (Standard/Premium/Enterprise): $X

**Implementation Costs** (One-Time):
- Professional services: $X
- Migration effort: $X
- Training: $X
- Downtime during migration: $X

**Ongoing Costs**:
- Reduced IT operations: X FTEs × $XXK = $X (fewer FTEs needed)
- Monitoring/management: $X (included in VK Cloud)

**Future State Total** (Steady State): $XXX,XXX/year

### 3. Quantify Benefits

**Cost Reduction**:
- Infrastructure cost savings: $X/year
- Personnel cost savings: $X/year
- Licensing cost savings: $X/year
- Operational efficiency: $X/year
- **Total Cost Reduction**: $XXX,XXX/year

**Revenue Impact**:
- Faster time-to-market: X weeks faster → $X revenue impact
- Improved uptime: 99.5% → 99.95% = X hours saved → $X
- Better performance: X% conversion increase → $X revenue
- Scale for growth: Support X% more customers → $X revenue
- **Total Revenue Impact**: $XXX,XXX/year

**Risk Reduction**:
- Reduced downtime risk: $X/year
- Improved security: $X/year (reduced breach risk)
- Compliance benefits: $X/year (avoid fines)
- Business continuity: $X/year
- **Total Risk Reduction**: $XXX,XXX/year

**Productivity Gains**:
- Developer productivity: X% improvement × X devs × $XXK = $X/year
- Operations efficiency: X hours saved/week × $X/hour = $X/year
- Reduced manual processes: $X/year
- **Total Productivity Gains**: $XXX,XXX/year

**Total Annual Benefits**: $XXX,XXX/year

### 4. Calculate Financial Metrics

**ROI Calculation**:
```
Year 1 Net Benefit = Benefits - (Implementation + Annual Costs)
Year 1 Net Benefit = $XXX,XXX - ($XX,XXX + $XX,XXX) = $XX,XXX

3-Year Total Benefits = $XXX,XXX × 3 = $X,XXX,XXX
3-Year Total Costs = Implementation + (Annual × 3) = $XX,XXX + ($XX,XXX × 3) = $XXX,XXX
3-Year Net Benefit = $X,XXX,XXX - $XXX,XXX = $X,XXX,XXX

ROI = (Net Benefit / Total Cost) × 100%
ROI = ($X,XXX,XXX / $XXX,XXX) × 100% = XXX%
```

**Payback Period**:
```
Payback Period = Implementation Cost / Annual Net Benefit
Payback Period = $XX,XXX / $XXX,XXX = X.X years
```

**NPV (Net Present Value)**:
```
Discount Rate: 10% (typical corporate cost of capital)

NPV = Σ (Net Benefit / (1 + r)^t) - Implementation Cost

Year 0: -$XX,XXX (implementation)
Year 1: $XXX,XXX / 1.10 = $XXX,XXX
Year 2: $XXX,XXX / 1.21 = $XXX,XXX
Year 3: $XXX,XXX / 1.33 = $XXX,XXX

NPV = -$XX,XXX + $XXX,XXX + $XXX,XXX + $XXX,XXX = $X,XXX,XXX
```

**IRR (Internal Rate of Return)**:
```
IRR = Discount rate where NPV = 0
Calculated IRR: XX%

If IRR > Cost of Capital (10%), project is financially attractive
```

### 5. Sensitivity Analysis

Show best case, expected case, worst case:

| Scenario | Benefits | Costs | Net Benefit | ROI | Payback |
|----------|----------|-------|-------------|-----|---------|
| **Best Case** (+20% benefits, -10% costs) | $XXX,XXX | $XX,XXX | $XXX,XXX | XXX% | X.X years |
| **Expected Case** (baseline) | $XXX,XXX | $XX,XXX | $XXX,XXX | XXX% | X.X years |
| **Worst Case** (-20% benefits, +10% costs) | $XX,XXX | $XXX,XXX | $XX,XXX | XX% | X.X years |

**Key Takeaway**: Even in worst case, ROI is still positive at XX%

### 6. Comparison vs. Alternatives

**VK Cloud vs. AWS**:
| Metric | VK Cloud | AWS | Difference |
|--------|----------|-----|------------|
| Annual Cost | $XXX,XXX | $XXX,XXX | -30% (VK wins) |
| Implementation | $XX,XXX | $XX,XXX | Similar |
| Support Quality | Russian 24/7 | English, limited | VK wins |
| Data Sovereignty | Full compliance | Uncertain | VK wins |
| 3-Year TCO | $X,XXX,XXX | $X,XXX,XXX | -$XXX,XXX (VK wins) |

**VK Cloud vs. On-Premises**:
| Metric | VK Cloud | On-Premises | Difference |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Annual Cost | $XXX,XXX | $XXX,XXX | -40% (VK wins) |
| CapEx | $XX,XXX | $XXX,XXX | -$XXX,XXX (VK wins) |
| Scalability | Instant | Weeks | VK wins |
| Ops Burden | Minimal | High | VK wins |
| 3-Year TCO | $X,XXX,XXX | $X,XXX,XXX | -$XXX,XXX (VK wins) |

### 7. Generate ROI Report

Create executive summary with:

**Investment Overview**:
- Total 3-year investment: $XXX,XXX
- 3-year net benefit: $X,XXX,XXX
- **ROI: XXX%**
- **Payback: X.X years**
- **NPV: $X,XXX,XXX**

**Visual Aids**:
- Cash flow diagram (annual costs vs. benefits)
- Payback period chart (cumulative net benefit)
- Cost comparison bar chart (VK vs. alternatives)
- ROI sensitivity analysis chart

**Recommendations**:
- Financial case is strong (ROI > XXX%, payback < X years)
- Risk-adjusted returns are attractive
- NPV is positive even in worst-case scenario
- Recommend proceeding with implementation

## Output Format

Provide:
1. **Executive Summary** (1 page): Key metrics, recommendation
2. **Detailed Financial Model** (2-3 pages): Costs, benefits, calculations
3. **Sensitivity Analysis** (1 page): Best/worst/expected cases
4. **Competitive Comparison** (1 page): TCO vs. alternatives
5. **Appendix**: Assumptions, methodology, data sources

Use tables, charts, and visualizations for executive audiences.

## Example Interaction

**You**: "Let's calculate the ROI for VK Cloud. What's the customer's current annual IT infrastructure cost?"

**User**: "About $500K/year on-premises, plus $200K in cloud costs."

**You**: "Got it. Let's break that down:

**Current State**:
- What's the breakdown? (hardware, personnel, licensing, datacenter)
- How many IT staff dedicated to infrastructure?
- What's your downtime cost per hour?
- What inefficiencies exist that we can quantify?"

After gathering information, generate comprehensive ROI analysis.

## Tips

- **Conservative Assumptions**: Under-promise, over-deliver
- **Quantify Everything**: No vague claims like "significant savings"
- **Show Your Work**: Document all assumptions
- **CFO Language**: NPV, IRR, payback—not just ROI percentages
- **Risk-Adjusted**: Factor in probabilities and worst cases
- **Apples-to-Apples**: Fair comparison across alternatives
- **Third-Party Data**: Cite Gartner, IDC, analyst reports
- **Visual**: Charts and graphs for executive audiences

Activate the business-value-frameworks skill for guidance.
