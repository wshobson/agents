# Deal Strategy Workshop

You will conduct a strategic deal planning session to develop a winning strategy for an enterprise opportunity.

## Process

### 1. Opportunity Discovery

Gather information about the opportunity:

**Deal Basics**:
- Company name and industry
- Deal size (target ARR)
- Products/services in scope
- Expected close date
- Sales cycle stage (Discovery, Evaluation, Proof, Negotiation, Close)

**MEDDPICC Assessment**:

**Metrics**: What quantified business value will this deliver?
- Cost savings, revenue growth, efficiency gains
- ROI, payback period

**Economic Buyer**: Who has budget authority?
- Name, title, department
- Have we engaged them directly?
- What are their priorities?

**Decision Criteria**: What are the requirements?
- Technical requirements
- Business requirements
- How well do we fit vs. competitors?

**Decision Process**: What's the approval process?
- Who is involved in decision (RACI)?
- What are the approval gates?
- What's the timeline for each stage?

**Paper Process**: What's the contracting process?
- Procurement involvement
- Legal review process
- Typical duration

**Identify Pain**: What business problem drives urgency?
- Quantified pain (dollars, time, risk)
- Cost of inaction
- Compelling event (deadline, contract renewal, regulation)

**Champion**: Who sells for us internally?
- Name, title, credibility
- Why do they want us to win?
- How actively are they coaching us?

**Competition**: Who else are they evaluating?
- Direct competitors (AWS, Azure, Yandex, etc.)
- Status quo (do nothing)
- Our competitive position

### 2. Competitive Analysis

For each competitor:
- Why might customer choose them?
- Why will we win vs. them?
- What proof points do we have?
- What landmine questions expose their weaknesses?

### 3. Stakeholder Strategy

**Power Mapping**:
Create a 2x2 matrix:
- High Power/High Support: **Champions** (leverage)
- High Power/Low Support: **Blockers** (address or work around)
- Low Power/High Support: **Advocates** (use to influence)
- Low Power/Low Support: **Neutral** (deprioritize)

**Engagement Plan**:
- Who do we need to engage that we haven't?
- What does each stakeholder need to see/hear?
- How do we strengthen relationships with champions?
- How do we convert neutrals to supporters?

### 4. Win Strategy

Based on analysis, develop specific plays:

**Strategic Plays**:
- **Direct Assault**: Head-to-head competition (when you have clear advantage)
- **Flanking Maneuver**: Enter through different angle (different BU, use case, partnership)
- **Siege Warfare**: Long-term relationship building and patience
- **Guerrilla Tactics**: Speed, agility, and personalized attention

**Proof Strategy**:
- What evidence do we need to provide? (demo, POC, reference calls, case studies)
- What success criteria must we meet?
- What risks need mitigation?

**Value Proposition**:
- What business outcomes will we deliver?
- How do we differentiate from alternatives?
- What's our elevator pitch for this specific customer?

### 5. Action Plan

Generate specific next steps:
- Actions with owners and due dates
- Stakeholder engagement plan
- Materials needed (presentations, proposals, case studies)
- Timeline with milestones
- Risk mitigation tasks

### 6. Deal Scoring

Score the opportunity on MEDDPICC (0-2 points each, 16 total):
- **14-16 (Green)**: High confidence, well-qualified
- **10-13 (Yellow)**: Gaps to address
- **0-9 (Red)**: Disqualify or major work needed

Recommend: Pursue, Qualify Further, or Disqualify

## Output Format

Provide a comprehensive deal strategy document including:

1. **Executive Summary**: Deal overview, MEDDPICC score, recommendation
2. **MEDDPICC Assessment**: Detailed scoring for each element
3. **Competitive Analysis**: Competitor-by-competitor breakdown
4. **Stakeholder Map**: Power map with engagement strategy
5. **Win Strategy**: Specific plays and tactics
6. **Action Plan**: Next 30-60-90 day roadmap
7. **Risk Register**: Risks with mitigation plans

## Example Interaction

**You**: "Let's develop a winning strategy for your deal. What company is this opportunity with?"

**User**: "Yandex. $2M deal for VK Kubernetes and Data Platform."

**You**: "Excellent. Let's start with MEDDPICC qualification:

**Metrics**: What quantified business value will Yandex achieve? (cost savings, revenue impact, efficiency)"

[Continue through MEDDPICC...]

After gathering information, provide comprehensive deal strategy with specific recommendations.

## Tips

- **Be Brutally Honest**: If deal is poorly qualified, say so
- **Challenge Assumptions**: Don't accept "we have a champion" without testing
- **Quantify**: Vague value propositions lose. Get specific numbers.
- **Competitive Intel**: Assume you're competing. Know your enemy.
- **Action-Oriented**: Every strategy session should result in clear next steps
- **Timeline-Driven**: Align actions to close date
- **Risk-Aware**: Identify what could cause deal to slip or lose

Activate the enterprise-sales-methodology skill and competitive-positioning skill.
