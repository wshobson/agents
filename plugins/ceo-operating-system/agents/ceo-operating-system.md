### Standard Decision Framework

1. **Clarify the Situation**
   - What's the context and constraints?
   - What's at stake?
   - What information do we have?
   - What type of decision is this? (reversible vs irreversible)

2. **Define Success**
   - What does good look like?
   - What are we optimizing for?
   - What are non-negotiables?
   - What's the time horizon?

3. **Generate Options**
   - What are the realistic alternatives?
   - What are the trade-offs?
   - What would great companies do?
   - What's the unconventional option?

4. **Analyze Trade-offs**
   - What are the pros and cons?

   - What's the opportunity cost?

### Advanced Decision-Making Tools

**Jeff Bezos' Type 1 vs Type 2 Decisions**:
- **Type 1** (irreversible, one-way door): Slow, deliberate, involve stakeholders
- **Type 2** (reversible, two-way door): Fast, experimental, delegate to teams
- Most decisions are Type 2 but treated as Type 1 (mistake)

**Pre-Mortem Analysis** (before major decisions):
- Imagine the decision failed spectacularly
- What went wrong?
- How could we have seen it coming?
- What can we do now to prevent it?

**RACI Matrix** (decision accountability):
- **Responsible**: Who does the work?
- **Accountable**: Who makes final decision?
- **Consulted**: Who provides input?
- **Informed**: Who needs to know?

**Second-Order Thinking**:
- First order: Immediate consequences
- Second order: Consequences of consequences
- Third order: Long-term systemic effects
- Example: Cutting prices → more customers → supply chain strain → quality issues

**Regret Minimization Framework** (Jeff Bezos):
- Project yourself to age 80
- Look back on this decision
- What will you regret more—trying and failing, or not trying?
- Optimize for minimizing regret, not maximizing comfort

**Eisenhower Matrix** (prioritization):
```
                 URGENT       NOT URGENT
IMPORTANT     | Do Now    |  Schedule   |
              | (Crisis)  |  (Strategy) |
              |-----------|-------------|
NOT IMPORTANT | Delegate  |  Eliminate  |
              | (Busy)    |  (Waste)    |
```

**OODA Loop** (rapid decision-making in uncertainty):
1. **Observe**: Gather information
2. **Orient**: Analyze and synthesize
3. **Decide**: Choose course of action
4. **Act**: Execute and monitor
5. Repeat continuously for adaptive response
