### Organizational Structures

**Common Structures**:

**Functional Organization** (by function):
```
CEO
├── VP Engineering
├── VP Product
├── VP Marketing
└── VP Sales
```
Best for: Small companies, clear functional expertise
Challenges: Silos, slow cross-functional decisions

**Product/Market Organization** (by product or market):
```
CEO
├── SVP Product A
│   ├── Engineering
│   ├── Product
│   └── Marketing
└── SVP Product B
    ├── Engineering
    ├── Product
    └── Marketing
```
Best for: Multiple products/markets, autonomy needed
Challenges: Duplication, harder to scale shared functions

**Matrix Organization** (hybrid):
```
CEO
├── VP Engineering (shared across products)
├── VP Product (shared across products)
└── Product Leaders
    ├── Lead for Product A
    └── Lead for Product B
```
Best for: Balance between specialization and focus
Challenges: Complexity, potential for unclear priorities

**Choosing Your Structure**:
1. What's the primary way we create value?

### Defining Culture & Values

**Company Culture**:

Culture is "how we do things around here" - the shared values, behaviors, and ways of working.

**Defining Your Culture**:

**Step 1: Identify Core Values**:
- What do we fundamentally believe?
- How do we want to treat people?
- What behaviors do we expect?
- What are we NOT?

**Example Values**:
- Transparency: We communicate openly and honestly
- Customer-obsessed: Customer success is our #1 priority
- Execution-focused: We ship and iterate fast
- Learning culture: We learn from failures and improve
- Diversity & inclusion: Different perspectives make us stronger

**Step 2: Define Behaviors**:
For each value, what does it look like in practice?
- Example: "Transparency" means:
  - Share information broadly, not hoarded
  - Admit mistakes and learn from them
  - Give direct feedback
  - Share both good and bad news

**Step 3: Live the Culture**:
- Hiring: Do candidates embody values?
- Performance management: Are we evaluating against values?
- Recognition: Celebrate people living values
- Consequences: Address violations of values
- Leadership modeling: Do leaders embody values?

**Step 4: Communicate & Reinforce**:
- Share stories that demonstrate culture
- Regular communication about values
- Rituals and traditions that reinforce culture
- New employee onboarding and indoctrination
- Regular culture reviews and evolution

### Communication & Transparency

**Leadership Communication**:

**Regular Cadence**:

- **Monthly**: Skip-level 1-on-1s (connect with people 2 levels below)
- **Quarterly**: Town halls (strategy, results, forward look)
- **Annual**: Offsite and strategy session

**What to Communicate**:
- **Progress**: How are we doing vs. goals?
- **Changes**: What's new or different?
- **Decisions**: What are we doing and why?
- **Celebration**: Wins and individual recognition
- **Challenges**: What we're struggling with
- **Strategy**: Where are we going?

**How to Communicate**:
- Be clear and direct (avoid jargon)
- Tell stories (engage emotion)
- Show data (ground in facts)
- Explain the why (help people understand)
- Invite questions (dialogue not monologue)
- Follow up consistently

### Compensation & Equity

**Compensation Strategy**:

**Base Salary**:
- Market competitive (50th-75th percentile for role)
- Fair across company (avoid huge disparities)
- Transparent or semi-transparent
- Adjusted based on role, experience, performance

**Variable Compensation** (bonus):
- Typically 10-30% of base for employees
- 30-100%+ of base for executives
- Tied to company and individual goals
- Performance-based (carrot and stick)

**Equity**:
- Early employees get more equity
- Longer vesting period (4 years typical)
- Cliff vesting (1 year) before any vesting
- Strike price at fair market value
- Equity re-negotiation during financing rounds

**Equity Guidelines** (as % of company):
- CEO: 10-15% at founding
- Early employees: 1-2% each
- Investors: Based on funding round
- Employees pool: 10-20% allocated over time

## World-Class Leadership Practices

- **Cognitive Ability**: Can they solve complex problems?
- **Leadership**: Can they step up when needed?
- **Role-Related Knowledge**: Do they have the skills?
- **Googleyness**: Will they add to culture?
- **Committee Decision**: No single person decides (reduces bias)

**Netflix's Keeper Test**:
- Ask: "If this person resigned, would I fight to keep them?"
- If answer is no, give them generous severance now
- Better to have smaller team of rock stars than large team of average
- Pay top of market for top talent

**Amazon's Bar Raiser Program**:

### Leadership Development

**McKinsey's Leadership Model**:
- **Think**: Strategic thinking and problem-solving
- **Lead**: Inspire and develop people
- **Do**: Execute with excellence and drive results
- Develop all three dimensions systematically

**GE's 9-Box Talent Review**:
```
           Low Performance  Medium Performance  High Performance
High       Question Mark   High Potential      Star
Potential

Medium     Train/Move      Core Player         High Professional
Potential

Low        Exit            Inconsistent        Solid Professional
Potential
```

**Facebook/Meta's Bootcamp**:
- All engineers (even senior) go through bootcamp

### High-Performance Team Building

**Patrick Lencioni's 5 Dysfunctions**:
1. **Absence of Trust**: Team members don't open up
2. **Fear of Conflict**: Avoid healthy debate
3. **Lack of Commitment**: No buy-in to decisions
4. **Avoidance of Accountability**: Don't call out poor behavior
5. **Inattention to Results**: Focus on individual over team

**Fix**: Build trust → encourage conflict → achieve commitment → hold accountable → focus on results

**Amazon's Two-Pizza Teams**:
- Teams should be small enough to feed with two pizzas (6-10 people)
- Small teams move faster and communicate better
- Clear ownership and accountability
- Minimize dependencies and coordination overhead

**Spotify's Squad Model**:
- **Squad**: Cross-functional team (product/design/eng)
- **Tribe**: Collection of squads in related area
- **Chapter**: People with same skill across squads
- **Guild**: Interest communities across company
- Balance autonomy with alignment

### Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI)

**Salesforce's Equality Framework**:
- Equal pay audits and corrections

**Best Practices**:
- Diverse candidate slates (Rooney Rule)
- Structured interviews reduce bias

- Psychological safety in teams

### Feedback & Performance Management

**Ray Dalio's Radical Transparency** (Bridgewater):
- All meetings recorded and available to everyone
- Real-time feedback through "dots" system
- Issue logs that track problems and resolutions
- Culture of challenging ideas, not people
- Baseball card ratings showing strengths/weaknesses

**Kim Scott's Radical Candor**:
```
              CARE PERSONALLY
                    |
    Ruinous      ✓  |  Radical
    Empathy         |  Candor
                    |
  ------------------|------------------
                    |
    Manipulative    |  Obnoxious
    Insincerity     |  Aggression
                    |
           CHALLENGE DIRECTLY
```

- **Radical Candor**: Care + Challenge (best)
- **Ruinous Empathy**: Care without challenge (harmful)
- **Obnoxious Aggression**: Challenge without care (jerk)
- **Manipulative Insincerity**: Neither care nor challenge (worst)

**Adobe's Check-In System** (replaced annual reviews):
- Continuous feedback, not annual event
- Regular 1-on-1s with clear expectations

- Strong written communication culture
- Time zone awareness and respect

**Best Practices for Hybrid/Remote**:
- Equal experience for remote and in-office
- Avoid hybrid meetings (all remote or all in-person)
