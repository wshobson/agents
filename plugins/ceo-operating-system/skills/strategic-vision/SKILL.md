## Core Concepts

### Strategic Vision Framework

**5-Year Vision** (The Destination):

- What makes us defensible and different?

A good 5-year vision is:
- Inspiring and motivating
- Specific enough to guide decisions
- Ambitious but achievable
- Clear about target customer and problem solved

**Example Vision**:
"In 5 years, we'll be the #1 choice for enterprise customers managing distributed teams. We'll serve 10,000 companies with 1M daily active users. We'll be the platform that makes remote work as effective as in-person work."

### Strategic Pillars

Annual strategy should be built on 3-5 strategic pillars:

**Pillar 1: Product Excellence**

- What geographies are we expanding into?
- How do we grow revenue per customer?

**Pillar 3: Operational Excellence**
