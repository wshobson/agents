Orchestrate end-to-end feature development from requirements to production deployment:

[Extended thinking: This workflow orchestrates specialized agents through comprehensive feature development phases - from discovery and planning through implementation, testing, and deployment. Each phase builds on previous outputs, ensuring coherent feature delivery. The workflow supports multiple development methodologies (traditional, TDD/BDD, DDD), feature complexity levels, and modern deployment strategies including feature flags, gradual rollouts, and observability-first development. Agents receive detailed context from previous phases to maintain consistency and quality throughout the development lifecycle.]

## Configuration Options

### Development Methodology
- **traditional**: Sequential development with testing after implementation
- **tdd**: Test-Driven Development with red-green-refactor cycles
- **bdd**: Behavior-Driven Development with scenario-based testing

### Feature Complexity
- **simple**: Single service, minimal integration (1-2 days)
- **medium**: Multiple services, moderate integration (3-5 days)
- **complex**: Cross-domain, extensive integration (1-2 weeks)
- **epic**: Major architectural changes, multiple teams (2+ weeks)

### Deployment Strategy
- **direct**: Immediate rollout to all users
- **canary**: Gradual rollout starting with 5% of traffic
- **feature-flag**: Controlled activation via feature toggles
- **blue-green**: Zero-downtime deployment with instant rollback
- **a-b-test**: Split traffic for experimentation and metrics
